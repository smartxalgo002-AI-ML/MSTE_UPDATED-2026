        "condensed_text": "The Indian stock market turned into the green in Friday’s session on February 6 after a range-bound trade, supported by gains in FMCG and select private banking stocks, which helped offset losses in IT, pharma and auto shares. At its sixth and final bi-monthly monetary policy review for the current financial year, the central bank decided to retain the repo rate at 5.25% and maintained a neutral stance. In terms of sector-wise performance, Nifty FMCG led the gainers with a 2.27% surge, while Nifty Consumer Durables, Nifty Oil & Gas, and Nifty Realty also ended higher, posting gains of up to 1%. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, said, \"Domestic equity markets traded largely subdued through most of the session before staging a late recovery, supported by selective buying in FMCG and private banking stocks. However, markets had anticipated a mildly dovish undertone, which failed to materialise as the RBI retained its neutral stance, resulting in an uptick in India’s 10-year bond yields,\" he further added.",
