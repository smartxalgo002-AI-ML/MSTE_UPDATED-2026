        "condensed_text": "Bharti Airtel is still awaiting a response from the government on its request seeking clarity over the treatment of its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, with Executive Vice Chairman Gopal Vittal stating that the company has formally written a couple of letters to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) requesting parity in the handling of these liabilities. Responding to analysts’ queries on AGR during the Q3 earnings call, Vittal said the telecom operator has already sent multiple letters to the DoT seeking clarification and equal treatment on the dues issue. While Vittal did not elaborate on the specifics of the relief or parity being sought, his remarks indicate that Airtel is closely monitoring any policy or administrative developments related to AGR liabilities and is seeking consistency in the government’s approach across operators. These are areas we have written to the DoT about, seeking an assessment based on parity and in line with the Supreme Court ruling.”\nThe comments come after the Union Cabinet last month froze Vodafone Idea’s AGR dues at Rs 87,695 crore as of December 31, 2025, and approved a staggered repayment schedule allowing the telco to clear the outstanding amount between FY32 and FY41. Meanwhile,Bharti Airtel’sdeferred payment liability towards AGR stood at Rs 38,604 crore, according to its FY25 annual report.",
