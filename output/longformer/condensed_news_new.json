Separately, Mohol disclosed that IndiGo, India's largest airline by market share, cancelled 6,936 flights over the past three months, impacting 10,81,680 passengers. He attributed December 2025 cancellations to multiple factors, including “over optimisation of operations, inadequate regulatory preparedness, along with deficiencies in system software support, shortcomings in management structure and operational control.”\nHe also noted that a significant number of December cancellations were linked to adverse weather conditions. IndiGo cancelled about 4,500 flights in the first weeks of December, stranding tens of thousands of passengers nationwide and highlighting concerns over limited competition in the world's fastest-growing aviation market.",

Gross margins touched their highest level in the past 15 quarters, aided by input cost moderation.However, EBITDA margin remained under pressure due to negative operating leverage and sustained investments in brand building, according to management.Segmental trends and outlookKey focus segments — waterproofing, construction chemicals and wood coatings — continued to deliver healthy growth. Automotive coatings registered mid-single-digit growth, while protective and general industrial coatings also saw positive momentum.Commenting on the outlook, Abhijit Roy, Managing Director &amp; CEO, said demand indicators have been improving sequentially, with month-on-month upticks across segments. He added that these trends, along with margin stability within guidance, are expected to coalesce into better performance in the coming months, though near-term risks from forex volatility and geopolitical uncertainty remain.Also Read: Max Healthcare Q3 Results: Revenue up 9% YoY; occupancy dips, ARPOB rises 3%The company reaffirmed its focus on network expansion, innovation and brand building, while also highlighting strong ESG performance, with Berger Paints scoring 64 on NSE’s ESG parameters, ahead of industry peers.",

        "condensed_text": "The report, titled ‘Transforming Indian healthcare, one specialty at a time’, said focused, single-speciality providers are emerging as the fastest-growing segment of India’s healthcare ecosystem. While multi-speciality hospitals continue to play a critical role in complex care, a parallel ecosystem of specialised providers is scaling rapidly, driven by repeatable care protocols, concentrated clinical expertise and asset-light expansion models. These platforms are purpose-built for scale, the report said, adding that speciality-native providers are increasingly preferred in high-volume, repeatable care segments such as eyecare, oncology and dental care. The investment firm has backed this thesis through investments in companies such as NephroPlus, which operates dialysis centres across India and overseas markets including Nepal, the Philippines and Uzbekistan; Pluro, which focuses on IVF care; and Sukino, which provides continuum care services. “As this market races toward $12 billion, we expect the next generation of iconic Indian healthcare companies will be built one speciality at a time,” said Nithin Kaimal, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, India.",

The court also restrained all the tribunals and high courts from passing any order that may lead to the stalling of the construction work to be completed by the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) Limited. A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi used its extra-ordinary power under Article 142 of the Constitution to uphold the December 12, 2024 order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), asking the NBCC to take over the projects in the interest of the homebuyers. The CJI made it clear that the interest and dues of the financial and operation creditors of the debt-ridden real estate firm can be taken care of only after the delivery of fully-furnished houses to the hassled homebuyers. “We find that the order passed by the NCLAT on December 12, 2024, in bringing the NBCC on record for the completion of the pending housing projects is neither unfair nor contrary to the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC),” the bench ordered while taking recourse of Article 142.",
