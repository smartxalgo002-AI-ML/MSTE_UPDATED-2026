IT stocks staged a sharp recovery on February 13 as value buying was seen in the battered stocks after they fell up to 6% in morning session on sell-off in the US due to the susceptibility of US companies to disruption by artificial intelligence. Major IT players such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro were the worst-hit stocks in the Nifty 50 index. The Nifty IT index fell over 5% to an over 10-month low of 31422.60 points. However, value buying was seen in the stocks with the ten-constituent Nifty IT index rising over 4 percentage points from day's low.",

        "condensed_text": "Telcos can't hold spectrum amid bankruptcy proceedings: SC. In a significant ruling, the Supreme Court of India rejected an appeal from lenders and defaulting telcos seeking to classify spectrum as an asset during the bankruptcy resolution.The decision came in cases involving Aircel and Reliance Communications, and their lenders  who argued that excluding spectrum from resolution processes would render any revival efforts futile, leaving \"nothing to resolve.\"The appellants urged the court to recognise the right to use spectrum as a transferable asset, enabling its utilisation in restructuring distressed telecom entities.However, the bench held that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy cannot guide the principles governing spectrum ownership and control.The court affirmed that spectrum constitutes a \"material resource of the community,\" with its ownership and control needing to be safeguarded for public interest rather than private insolvency proceedings.The Centre had backed this stance, contending that spectrum is a national resource not amenable to restructuring under the IBC, preventing its commodification in corporate defaults.Track the latest Q3 earnings here.Read more: Explained | Why gold is suddenly trading at a discount in India",
