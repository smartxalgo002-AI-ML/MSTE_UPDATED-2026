The management has laid out 5-year strategy (“Lakshya”) to doubling down on high growth areas and focus on quality revenues, while eliminating commoditized play. We believe the strategy is margin accretive from the quarter itself, but plugging the topline gaps would be challenging in the near-term, where Sustainability remains the only growth engine.

        "condensed_text": "Wipro shares gained momentum ahead of its December quarter results, rising 3.7% intraday to hit a high of Rs 269.80 on the BSE. The rally reflects investor optimism as the IT major prepares to announce its Q3 earnings later today, with the Street watching for updates on margins, deal wins and the impact of recent acquisitions such as Harman. According to an average of estimates from six brokerages, Wipro’s profit after tax for Q3FY26 is expected to rise by just 0.4% year-on-year. Brokerages expect Wipro’s IT services revenue to grow between 0.5% and 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency terms, aided by contributions from recent acquisitions. As Wipro prepares to release its earnings later today, investors will look for forward-looking guidance on deal momentum, cost optimisation, and clarity on the margin trajectory amid ongoing macro pressures.",

        "condensed_text": "Morgan Stanley’s Ridham Desai , who leads the firm’s India equity strategy team, has identified three specific capital market reforms that could meaningfully reverse the FII outflow narrative that has plagued Indian markets. In this context, it is quite possible that the Budget proposes broadening the base of foreign portfolio investors, allowing more pools of capital to access Indian stocks,” Desai said in a Budget strategy note. The two other reforms could focus on simplifying buyback taxation—which currently risks distorting capital structures and hurting long-term capital market flows—and further enhancing tax benefits at GIFT City, he said. Live Events “It appears the market is expecting modest fiscal consolidation to protect growth, flat to higher capital spending as a percentage of GDP, and some additional tax incentives for manufacturing,” he said, adding that the Budget is likely to focus on deficit reduction, government capital expenditure, the debt calendar, and capital market reforms aimed at boosting foreign inflows. “This year, India is tracking lower on both an absolute and relative basis, and if it were to hold this performance into the budget day, the chances of a post-budget rally increase,” the global brokerage said.",

Commenting on the outlook for the rail sector, Vivek Lohia, Managing Director at Jupiter Wagons, said the upcoming Budget comes at a time when execution and reforms are becoming as important as overall allocations. \"Based on recent trends, the rail outlay is expected to see a calibrated increase of around five per cent, taking the overall allocation to approximately Rs 2.65 lakh crore, including extra-budgetary resources. With electrification nearing completion, capital deployment is likely to be redirected toward easing congestion through new lines, gauge conversion, track doubling, and the expansion of Dedicated Freight Corridors and economic corridors linked to ports and mineral clusters.\" \"The reform agenda's focus on faster adoption of artificial intelligence and advanced technologies for safety, predictive maintenance, and train operations is particularly encouraging, as it reflects a shift from asset creation alone to measurable performance outcomes.\"",

The ship Maersk Detroit, with planned departure from Port Tangier, Morocco, on February 3, will return to the Trans-Suez route on all Eastbound MECL service sailings, the shipping major said. Following this, in December, Danish shipping major Maersk said it would gradually consider a wider East-West network shift back to the trans-Suez corridor, depending on whether security thresholds continue to be met. The decision to return to the Suez Canal follows a continued stabilisation of conditions in and around the Red Sea, including the Suez corridor, as well as improved stability and reliability in the region, allowing us to return to the service pattern originally designed to provide our customers with the most efficient transit times. Maersk has contingency plans in place should the security situation deteriorate, which may necessitate reverting individual MECL sailings or the wider structural change of the MECL service back to the Cape of Good Hope route, the shipping major said.",

        "condensed_text": "State Bank of India (SBI), IndusInd Bank and Bank of Baroda shares were up over 1 percent, while HDFC Bank, IDFC First Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Technical view on Bank Nifty:\nAakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking said that 59,900–60,000 is now a crucial resistance cluster, adding that a sustained move above this could revive short-term bullishness. Notably, the crucial mark has already been broken by the index, On the downside, the analyst believes that 59,300–59,400 is key support, and a break below may trigger further consolidation. However, if it trades below 59567 levels, we may witness profit booking in the market, and the index may correct up to 59337-59095-58865 levels,” the brokerage said. Nifty Bank is currently oscillating within a wide band of 58,800–60,000, and a decisive move beyond either end of this range is likely to determine the next directional trend,” he added.",

The two factors that will broadly determine the outlook for this year will be - the continued impact of various fiscal and monetary stimulus on the corporate earnings and the relative underperformance of Indian markets compared to the global peers. While there are pockets of significant overvaluations, we expect the fresh flows from both domestic and international investors to help reprice undervalued sectors such as banking, power, engineering & construction and business services. We believe with the relative valuation narrowing between India and other emerging markets and the economic growth rate improvement from 5.6% to 8.2% over the last one year, the case for FII inflows is becoming stronger. While only a limited number of companies have reported their earnings so far, the overall trend looks positive for the undervalued sectors, especially in financial services where both private and public sector mid-cap banks have reported strong earnings growth and improving asset quality.",

        "condensed_text": "India will revive tax proceedings against Tiger Global Management after a top court ruling related to the firm’s 2018 sale of its stake in online retailer Flipkart. The exit resulted in capital gains, with the aggregate consideration received exceeding Rs 14,500 crore ($1.6 billion), according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the person was not authorized to speak to the media. The US-based investment firm’s substantial sale of Flipkart’s stake to Walmart Inc. was one of the largest exits by a foreign investor in the Indian e-commerce sector. The Supreme Court held that Tiger Global’s capital gains are taxable under domestic law, overturning a Delhi High Court ruling. A refund worth Rs 970 crore claimed by Tiger Global and which has been withheld will also be added to the tax demand that the department will now serve, the official said.",

        "condensed_text": "Tiger Global's argument\nTiger Global had argued that it was exempted from capital gains tax arising out of the deal because the investments in Flipkart were made before April 1, 2017, when the India–Mauritius Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) provided immunity from Indian capital gains tax, subject to treaty conditions. Moreover, the US-based firm's Mauritius-based entities held valid Tax Residency Certificates (TRCs) issued by local authorities, on the basis of which the firm asserted full protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty and a nil tax liability in India. TheCBDT officials said that in large transactions, tax amountsare bound to be large simply because of the scale involved, and that pending demands or withheld refunds in such cases should not be seen as arbitrary or coercive, as they often stem from unresolved legal questions awaiting final judicial clarity. The department argued that the real control and decision-making powers for investments were outside Mauritius and the arrangement with entities \"appeared to be structured primarily to obtain treaty benefits\"\nWhat SC said\nThe top court allowed government's appeals and said Tiger Global's capital gains were taxable under Indian laws. \"The court held that mere possession of a TRC does not bar enquiry into whether an entity is a conduit; amendments to the India–Mauritius DTAA were intended to curb treaty abuse; and the revenue had established an impermissible avoidance arrangement.",

On the flipside, the lender’s loan growth is expected to remain healthy, while the bank's NIM is likely to slip year-on-year (YoY) and flat QoQ. According to Seema Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities, profit growth is expected to remain restrained, as stable core earnings may be partly offset by subdued non-interest income and limited treasury gains during the quarter. Seema Srivastava of SMC Global Securities believes that net interest income (NII) is likely to record modest year-on-year growth, aided by expansion in the advances book and repricing benefits, even as competitive pressures on deposits and elevated funding costs limit margin expansion. At the consolidated level, Systematix analysts forecast HDFC Bank ’s NII to rise about 6.4% YoY in Q3 FY26, supported by healthier loan growth and a gradual moderation in funding costs.",

At the same time, concerns around a weaker rupee and ongoing global trade-related issues remained on participants’ radar,\" Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, observed. \"The market is likely to take cues from the earnings announcements of key heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank in early trade on Monday, which could determine the next directional move,\" said Mishra. \"Participants are advised to maintain a selective, stock-specific approach, focusing on sectors showing relative strength such as IT, financials and metals, while adhering to disciplined risk management in the prevailing volatile environment,\" Mishra said. After completing its corrective phase, the stock has displayed resilience by consistently holding above its 20- and 50-week exponential moving averages (WEMA), reflecting a healthy underlying trend and strong buying interest at lower levels.",

        "condensed_text": "Yes Bank reported a robust operational performance for the December quarter, with net profit rising 55.4% year-on-year to ₹951.6 crore, compared with ₹612.3 crore in the year-ago period, aided by steady net interest income and improving asset quality.Net interest income  increased 11% year-on-year to ₹2,465.6 crore for Q3 FY26, up from ₹2,223.5 crore in the corresponding quarter last year, reflecting stable core lending performance.Asset quality remained steady in the December quarter. In absolute terms, gross NPAs fell to ₹4,014.6 crore from ₹4,055.3 crore, while net NPAs declined to ₹671.2 crore from ₹770.8 crore in the previous quarter.Other asset quality indicators also remained stable, with slippages easing to 1.6% from 2% in the previous quarter and 2.2% a year earlier, reflecting tighter underwriting and improved credit monitoring.Yes Bank’s margins showed a modest improvement during the quarter, with net interest margin rising to 2.6%, compared with 2.4% a year ago and 2.5% in the preceding quarter.Ahead of the earnings announcement, shares of Yes Bank closed at ₹23.45 on the NSE on Friday, up 2.18%.Earlier this month, speaking to CNBC-TV18, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Prashant Kumar said deposit growth has emerged as the biggest structural challenge for the banking sector, even as loan demand, profitability and asset quality remain healthy.Kumar noted that loan growth across the system has been consistently outpacing deposit mobilisation, pushing loan-to-deposit ratios to elevated levels and forcing banks to reassess how future growth is funded.Against this backdrop, Yes Bank’s recent performance reflects a calibrated strategy focused on profitable and sustainable growth rather than chasing volumes. The bank reported over 5% year-on-year growth in both advances and deposits during the October–December quarter, although deposits declined sequentially.Kumar said the performance was aligned with the bank’s stated objectives and that the outlook remains supported by India’s economic momentum, government initiatives and regulatory support.He added that credit growth is becoming increasingly broad-based, with corporate lending — particularly from manufacturing and services companies — showing signs of recovery after a prolonged slowdown. Retail lending, which accounts for nearly half of Yes Bank’s loan book, continues to remain a key focus area.Kumar said the bank has taken corrective steps by being more selective across asset classes and strengthening credit quality. While Yes Bank does not currently have a meaningful presence in certain fast-growing retail segments such as gold loans, entry into these areas will be evaluated as part of its longer-term three-to-five-year strategy.",

        "condensed_text": "RBL Bank flagged continued stress in its credit card portfolio during the December quarter, warning that elevated slippages could persist over the next two quarters, even as gold loan disbursals gathered momentum and margins showed signs of stabilising.Speaking at the post-earnings concall, Managing Director and CEO R Subramaniakumar said credit card slippages remained slightly elevated due to broader macro trends, though leading indicators were showing improvement. “We are okay with the trends we are seeing,” he said, while cautioning that similar levels of slippages could continue in the near term.At the same time, the bank highlighted steady traction in gold loans, with branch-led disbursals running at a monthly pace of ₹225–250 crore. Net interest income rose 4.6% year-on-year to ₹1,657.2 crore, slightly ahead of estimates.Asset quality improved sequentially, with gross non-performing assets declining to 1.88% from 2.32% in the previous quarter, while net NPAs edged lower to 0.55% from 0.57%.

Subramaniakumar said RBL is consciously moderating risk, with the unsecured book currently at around 26% of advances and expected to trend towards 25% or lower.On growth strategy, the management said retail secured assets will grow at a faster pace, supported by branch expansion and a sharper focus on granular deposits.",

The Net Interest Margins (NIMs) for the quarter stood at 3.18%, expanding by 12 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) and 7 bps year-on-year (YoY).

Kotak Institutional Equities is pegging YES Banks' NIIs at Rs 2,425.4 crore, up 9.1 per cent YoY and 5.4 per cent QoQ, with NIMs rising slightly to 2.9 per cent PPoP is seen at Rs 1,687.5 crore, up 11.6 per cent YoY and 2.6 per cent QoQ. We expect NIM at 2.9 per cent but there is likely to be a lot of volatility, given the nature of income booked when security receipts mature and impact of RIDF investments. On the other hand, ICICI Securities is expecting YES Bank's NIIs to come at Rs 2,429.7 crore, up 9.3 per cent YoY and 5.6 per cent QoQ in December 2025 quarter, with NIMs inching marginally higher at 2.54 per cent Its PPOP is seen at Rs 1,345.5crore, up 24.3 per cent YoY and 3.8 per cent QoQ.

He is a veteran of the ICICI Group since 1996.One of the clearest improvements under Bakshi has been in the lender's asset quality, with both gross and net non-performing assets  declining meaningfully from the period before his tenure to recent years.ICICI Bank's gross NPAs have contracted from multi-year elevated levels to approximately 1.6% by the second quarter of FY26, while net NPAs have remained below 0.4%, reflecting disciplined credit risk management.Meanwhile, the return on assets has increased from under 0.5% to over 2%, signalling stronger profitability and balance sheet utilisation.Across these years, the lender's capital position has stayed robust and credit growth steady, underpinning the case for continuity at the executive helm.ICICI Bank shares ended the previous session 0.4% lower at 1,413 apiece.

Trump’s trade policies, which have been a major source of disruption, are expected to diminish further as a dominant influence on the global economy. China’s GDP growth is expected to remain stable, while crude oil prices are likely to stay subdued, easing pressure on inflation and external balances. For FY27, Nifty earnings are expected to grow by 16%, translating into an anticipated annual return of about 11% for the index, pegging a yearly Nifty target of 28,720.",

With demand broad-based across states and categories, the company expects its premium and luxury offerings to anchor growth even as margins remain strong.Khaitan said Radico Khaitan expects its Prestige &amp; Above  category to deliver sustained growth of around 15% over the next two to three years, as the company sharpens its focus on premiumisation.the company is targeting a margin expansion of around 125 basis points on a sustained basis, aided by favourable raw material costs and a rising contribution from higher-margin premium and luxury products.In October-December quarter , Radico Khaitan reported revenue of ₹1,547 crore, net profit of ₹155 crore and margins at 17.3%.Below are the edited excerpts of the conversation.Q: The nine-month volumes are more than 40% that's nearly double of what you were guiding for earlier, when we are talking about more than 20%. As far as the luxury portfolio goes, it is doing extremely well, and we will be close to our ₹500 target.Q: What about your Luxury Portfolio, that ₹500 crores, you are on track this year itself?A: In the last five years, we have done a lot, we have launched six luxury brands, starting from Royal Ranthambore to Sangam to Rampur Barrel Blush, 'The Spirit of Kashmyr' vodka, The Kohinoor Reserve Indian Dark Rum and our latest Virasat Indian Single Malt. We had the highest ever EBITDA of ₹265 crores, which is a jump of 45% in EBITDA corresponding to the same quarter last year.Our net profit also grew by 61% to ₹154 crores so in fact, what we saw, and most importantly is our prestige &amp; above  category, grew by 25% which we are happiest about. Right ahead of the budget are there any risks that you foresee, especially given the recent crackdown that took place on tobacco?A: Everything in moderation is good, and I don't see our industry facing that pressure, because we are one of the highest contributors to any of the state government, and we have always seen, wherever there's been prohibition, there's been always a backlash.",

        "condensed_text": "Shares of Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd rallied as much as 3% to their fresh 52-week high of Rs 699 on the BSE on Friday after copper prices bounced back to inch closer to its fresh high of $13,407 on the London Metal Exchange. The brokerage has factored in value unlocking from the demerger and estimated the fair value of each entity under a FY28E sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) framework, maintaining Vedanta as a top pick. Accordingly, average price assumptions for FY27E and FY28E have been revised upward to $3,000 and $2,750 per tonne for aluminium, $3,000 and $2,900 per tonne for zinc, and $60 per ounce for silver. Vedanta Aluminium (including 51% of Balco) and Vedanta Limited (housing Hindustan Zinc , International Zinc, and others) are likely to continue dividend payouts, with expected DPS of ~Rs 15 from Vedanta Aluminium and ~Rs 5 from Vedanta Limited in FY27E/28E. As per Kotak, Vedanta will benefit from the ongoing commodities rally as nearly 85% of Vedanta’s FY2027E EBITDA is expected to be driven by aluminium (50%), zinc (20%) and silver (15%).",

        "condensed_text": "Bollywood war drama Border 2, starring Sunny Deol, Varun Dhawan, Diljit Dosanjh and Ahan Shetty, has overtaken Ranveer Singh’s Dhurandhar in advance booking figures ahead of its worldwide release.Trade experts and industry trackers said Border 2’s pre-sales crossed Dhurandhar’s benchmark on BookMyShow, India’s largest ticketing platform.Box office tracking portal Sacnilk reported that Border 2 sold more than 2.24 lakh tickets on BookMyShow in the final day before release, surpassing Dhurandhar’s pre-sales numbers. Estimates put the film’s first-day advance booking gross at around ₹12.5 crore, including a little over ₹5 lakh from premium formats such as Dolby Cine, 4DX and IMAX. Sacnilk data also indicated that the film’s first-day advance booking revenue rose sharply on Thursday, climbing from around ₹6 crore to ₹12 crore within 12 hours.By Friday morning, Border 2’s pre-sales reportedly crossed ₹10 crore, moving ahead of Dhurandhar, which collected just over ₹9 crore in advance bookings for its opening day. However, it has not yet surpassed Sunny Deol’s earlier record of ₹17.5 crore, set by Gadar 2 three years ago.Border 2 has a runtime of 3 hours and 16 minutes and is expected to see a wide release across India. Most bookings so far have come from Hindi 2D screenings, according to pre-release data.Industry analysts attributed the strong advance sales to the sequel’s patriotic theme and nostalgia around the Border franchise, which began with the 1997 film.With the Republic Day holiday weekend approaching, early projections estimate Border 2 could open in the ₹35–40 crore range.",

The scrutiny traces back to July 2022, when Carlyle and Advent invested $1.1 billion to pick up a combined 10% stake in the private lender. This leak reportedly enabled specific individuals, including friends and family members of the executives, to trade Yes Bank stock and make unlawful gains before the deal was publicly announced. SEBI reportedly found that both EY and PwC failed to maintain a ‘restricted list’, a standard compliance tool that prevents staff from trading in the shares of clients they are advising, the report said. Reuters reported that SEBI has specifically asked EY India Chairman Rajiv Memani to explain why penalties should not be imposed, arguing that the firm's internal policies failed to restrict trading in companies where it provided non-audit advisory services.",

        "condensed_text": "The Indian rupee hit a lifetime low of 91.95 against US Dollar on January 23, with a selloff in local equities adding to ongoing pressure from dollar outflows, importer payments and speculative flows. The rupee is now down more than 1% this week, weighed down by demand from bullion and other importers, speculative dollar buying by offshore players and foreign outflows from equities. The benchmark index dropped 0.8% on Friday, weighed by the selloff in shares of Adani group companies after the US Securities and Exchange Commission asked a court for permission to personally email summons to billionaire Gautam Adani. “The Adani issue has added another reason for the market to buy (into dollar/rupee),\" Anil Bhansali, head of treasury at Finrex Treasury Advisors, said. While the central bank sold dollars aggressively on at least two occasions this week, the intervention has so far only slowed, rather than reversed, the currency’s downward trend.",

        "condensed_text": "With margins improving and technology-led productivity gains kicking in, the company believes it is well placed to navigate evolving market dynamics.In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Anuj Kumar, Managing Director of Computer Age Management Services , spoke about the impact of regulatory changes on fund houses, the company’s growth outlook for FY27, and why he expects non-MF businesses to play a larger role in CAMS’ future growth.CAMS reported a steady quarter-on-quarter performance in the October-December quarter of 2025 , with revenue rising 3.6% to ₹390.14 crore from ₹376.70 crore in the previous quarter. EBITDA margin expanded by 135 basis points to 45.85% from 44.49%, while net profit rose 9.9% to ₹125.50 crore compared with ₹114.20 crore in the preceding quarter.The market capitalisation of Computer Age Management Services stands at around ₹16,943 crore, with the stock having declined close to 18% over the past year.Below are the edited excerpts from the interview.Q: Has Computer Age Management Services  seen any discussions with mutual funds on renegotiating contracts or pricing, given the regulator’s push to lower fees and the potential pressure this could place on fund houses’ cost structures?A: The objective of the regulator is to make the product cheaper for the marketplace and investors. So, when you put the impact of these two things together, we are just waiting and seeing whether they want to have a conversation on this, or whether they have figured out ways to absorb this.Q: So, you're saying 10 large mutual funds, and you'd be dealing with all of them, will see some impact?A: We deal with seven out of the 10 mutual funds.Q: So, there will be an impact on them because of the exit load going away. I mean, if they choose to come back to us, it will perhaps be in a three- to four-month time frame.Q: So maybe in the April-June quarter of 2025  of 2026-27  is when we should expect it?A: I would not set any definite expectation on it, because the entire exit load is about five bps. We don't issue guidance, but just the way we think the year will play out, all of that should be possible.Q: Revenue growth of 12–13% in FY27?A: Yes, absolutely.Q: Since you're sharing those numbers, and you said these negotiations will take place, could you give us a sense of how to think about the impact — worst case, base case and bull case?A: I'll give you a very broad, indicative number, not percentages, only absolute numbers.",

As gold and other alternatives take a larger share of India’s reserves, the shift mirrors moves by bigger holders like China, reviving questions about US exceptionalism and the role of its debt as a reserve asset. “The speed at which relations between the US and India deteriorated last year would have taken many by surprise and jolted policymakers to reduce their vulnerabilities,” said Shilan Shah of Capital Economics, the top rupee forecaster last quarter, according to Bloomberg rankings. The RBI isn’t a major holder of Treasuries, owning only one-quarter of China’s nearly $683 billion holdings and Japan’s $1.2 trillion book, according to data through November. A trade agreement “will simply see holdings stabilize, rather than India go on some sort of mass buying spree.”\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\nPublished on  January 23, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

Coforge also reiterated that it has decided not to go ahead with a qualified institutional placement (QIP) to retire Encora’s debt, saying it has secured financing from a consortium of banks at a “middle single digit” interest rate, with a clear focus on avoiding earnings per share dilution.",

More recently, the dollar gained 0.30% on November 4, 2025, following the New York City mayoral election, which markets interpreted as a stabilising signal for regulatory and political continuity in the US’s largest financial centre. Commenting on the findings, Adam Nasli, Head Broker Analyst at BrokerChooser, noted that while the dollar remains anchored by its reserve-currency status and deep capital markets, recent years have exposed heightened sensitivity to policy risk. “The dollar’s trajectory has been shaped not only by economic fundamentals but also by policy developments – including fiscal dynamics, tariff implications and questions around central bank independence – which have heightened sensitivity to shifts in investor confidence and risk appetite,” said Adam Nasli, Head Broker Analyst from brokerage and forex experts BrokerChooser. As fears of trade wars and global slowdowns persist into 2026, the dollar is likely to remain on a rollercoaster — responding not just to economic data, but to the political decisions that increasingly define the global financial landscape.",

A sharp 27.14% rise in expenses to 29.61 billion rupees and a 35.73% surge in finance costs absorbed most of the company’s topline, even as power sales remained strong. The country, which currently meets about a third of its power demand from thermal plants, aims to achieve net‑zero emissions by 2070 and plans to more than double its renewable capacity to 500 gigawatts as part of that effort. Finance costs for the company include interest on borrowings as well as currency‑related gains and losses on its foreign‑currencyloansand the impact of derivative hedges used to manage those exposures. The renewable energy arm of billionaire Gautam Adani’s group, which operates solar, wind and hybrid assets across India, said revenue from power supply rose 21% to 19.93 billion rupees, helped by 5.6 GW of capacity additions over the past year.",

The profit also missed the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of ₹477 crore, reflecting pressure from higher costs and the impact of exceptional items during the quarter.Below are the edited excerpts from the interview.Q: You've given a decent number this time in line with what the Street was expecting. So, we are consuming a lot of that out of the book, and that is giving us the confidence that we should be able to see acceleration in growth in Q4 and potentially sets us up very nicely for FY27 as well.Q: Let’s just talk about the last line that you mentioned, which sets you up very well for FY27. You did say 2025-26  is going to see that momentum vis-a-vis FY25, but what are you guiding for in FY27 when it comes to this kind of momentum?Rakesh: We will till April to give you formal guidance on FY27, given that we still have to get through Q4, and we are also quite excited about the state of our pipeline. What's going on, though, is that there's a pretty significant reprioritisation of spending, because they're trying to not only free up money from an efficiency standpoint, but they're also trying to figure out how they're going to invest in the new build-up and operating of the new AI stack.So, the alignment of our company's offerings, our client relationships, our ability to create deal architects that align to the squeeze, the run, feed, the change mindset, is actually what's driving a lot of the spend.",

Not more than six years back, they increased the axle load regulation, where the maximum GVW (gross vehicle weight) of a 5-axle truck used to be 37 tonne and 3718 was the highest selling vehicle.

This included mutual fund houses such as SBI MF, which bought NCDs worth Rs 2,500 crore, followed by Kotak MF, ICICI MF, Nippon India MF, Tata MF, Aditya Birla Sunlife MF, Axis MF, Invesco, UTI and Baroda BNP Paribas MF. The strong demand for Adani Power’s NCD’s came despite the latest development ofUS Securities and Exchange Commission asking a U.S. court for permission to personally email summons to Indian billionaire Gautam Adaniand group executive Sagar Adani over alleged fraud and a $265-million bribery scheme, according to a Reuters report on January 22. Earlier this month, the group’s flagship entity Adani Enterprises Ltd’s Rs 1,000-crore public NCD offering, launched on January 6, was fully subscribed in the first hour of the launch. Adani group companies have raised around Rs 15,000 crore from domestic bond offerings in the last one and half years, with close to Rs 3,000 crore raised from retail investors, driven by rising appetite for debt alternatives as equity markets have seen prolonged bouts of volatility amid global geo-political tensions and trade headwinds.",

        "condensed_text": "Apollo Tyres bets big on team India jersey for long-term brand value. Apollo Tyres has made a decisive long-term branding move by becoming the official sponsor of the Team India jersey across all formats for both men and women.Speaking to Storyboard18, Neeraj Kanwar, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Apollo Tyres, said the partnership was driven by reach, trust and emotional connection rather than short-term visibility.Kanwar explained that cricket offered unmatched penetration across India, including rural markets where traditional advertising has limited impact. The brand’s placement on the players’ jersey, rather than perimeter advertising, has already begun delivering results, with rising traction in car and two-wheeler tyre demand and a positive spillover expected across other segments.Udyan Ghai, Group Head of Marketing, said the sponsorship was evaluated through both short- and long-term lenses. Strategically, Apollo wanted a bold entry into cricket, a space dominated by long-standing competitors, while also using the association to drive the full marketing funnel from awareness to purchase.The company’s long-standing association with Sachin Tendulkar further strengthened conviction around the deal. Apollo also sees the partnership as culturally significant, especially after India’s women’s team lifted the World Cup during the sponsorship period, reinforcing the brand’s belief in equality and grassroots development.For the entire discussion, watch the accompanying videoAlso Read | GST cuts, cricket sponsorship drive tyre demand in India; Europe remains a tightrope for Apollo Tyres",

He noted that while the company maintains its primary plant in Pune's Chakan, Bengaluru has emerged as a critical pillar for the brand due to its rapid economic expansion and its role as home to a massive research and development centre. Iyer pointed out that the average age of a Mercedes-Benz buyer in India has dropped from 42 to 38, but the figures in the Karnataka capital are even more striking.

Policy support and indigenisation remain structural positives\nKotak Institutional Equities and Choice Equities remain constructive on BEL’s outlook, citing sustained government focus on defence indigenisation, rising capital outlays, andBEL’s positioning as a key integrator in defence electronics, which continue to underpin medium-term growth visibility.

The crisis, it said, was not triggered by a single event, but by a combination of over-optimisation of operations, inadequate regulatory preparedness, deficiencies in system software support, and, most critically, shortcomings inIndiGo’s management structure and operational control. 'Unprecedented operational breakdown'\nBetween December 3 and December 5, IndiGo cancelled more than 2,500 flights and delayed over 1,850, leaving upwards of 300,000 passengers stranded across airports in the country. According to the committee report, IndiGo’s management failed to adequately identify planning deficiencies, maintain sufficient operational buffers and effectively implement the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) provisions. Following the inquiry, the DGCA ordered IndiGo to reduce its daily flight operations by 10 percent — amounting to a cut of just over 200 flights from its usual schedule of 2,050–2,100 services a day.",

None of the 50 analysts that have coverage on Mumbai-based private lender Axis Bank Ltd. have a \"sell\" rating on the stock after it reported its third quarter results on Saturday. Brokerages such as Citi even upgraded the stock and revised its price target higher.44 out of the 50 analysts that now cover Axis Bank have a \"buy\" rating on the stock, while the other six have a \"hold\" rating.Citi upgraded Axis Bank to \"buy\" from its earlier rating of \"neutral\", and revised its price target higher to ₹1,463 from ₹1,323 earlier.The brokerage wrote in its note that Axis Bank's core earnings surprised positively yet again and it sees the lender's Returns on Assets at 1.5% led by lower slippages, falling credit costs, and lower employee expenses.All of these positives though, were partially mitigated by muted treasury gains and modest fee growth.Here's a look at what other analysts had to say:BernsteinThe brokerage maintained its \"outperform\" rating on the stock with a price target of ₹1,480. It attributed the fall in Axis Bank's margins, despite cost of funds being lower, to a corporate-led loan-mix shift.Asset quality trends remained stable, while higher credit costs, mainly due to the ongoing technical impact, kept a lid on its profitability.CLSAThe brokerage also has a \"outperform\" rating on Axis Bank with a price target of ₹1,500.CLSA stated that Axis Bank reported a strong third quarter with its Net Interest Income, Pre-Provisioning Operating Profit and Profit Before Tax  beating their estimates by 2%, 7% and 10% respectively.It called Axis Bank's asset quality improvement the highlight of the quarter.NomuraNomura's \"buy\" rating on Axis Bank comes with a price target of ₹1,540.It said that Axis Bank's credit cost visibility is improving and in a seasonally weak quarter, asset quality saw improvement with growth trends being on the rise.The brokerage expects Axis Bank's Return on Assets  to be between 1.7% to 1.8%, while its Return on Equity  to be at 15% over financial year 2027-2028, resulting in its earnings growing at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate of 26% over the same time frame.At a 21% discount to Kotak Mahindra Bank, Nomura finds Axis Bank's valuations to be attractive.JefferiesJefferies has a price target of ₹1,550 on Axis Bank, which comes with a \"buy\" rating as well.However, it expects a slight moderation in strong loan growth as another rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India may force the lender towards margin management or slower growth.Yet, it sees Axis Bank's valuations at 1.6 times one-year forward adjusted price-to-book for Return on Equity  of 14% to be attractive, similar to Nomura.Morgan Stanley has the highest price target on Axis Bank at ₹1,650 and that implies a potential upside of 32% from last Friday's closing levels.Axis Bank's asset quality improved significantly during the December quarter with provisions declining by 37% on a sequential basis.Shares of Axis Bank ended 3.2% lower last Friday during the market sell-off at ₹1,253.9. The stock has risen 32% over the last 12 months.",

Several brokerages have downgraded shares of drugmaker Cipla Ltd. following its December quarter results, with the stock falling in eight of the last nine trading sessions.Jefferies downgraded the stock to 'Underperform' and cut its price target to ₹1,170 per share, implying a potential downside of about 12% from Friday's closing levels.The brokerage said the Q3 performance missed expectations due to weak US sales, led by a quarter-on-quarter decline in gRevlimid and Lanreotide revenues.Jefferies also flagged management's decision to cut FY26 EBITDA margin guidance by 175 to 300 basis points, citing supply disruptions in Lanreotide, which are expected to persist through the first half of FY27.The brokerage expects top US products to witness a decline in FY27, with meaningful contributions from pipeline launches likely only from FY28 onwards. As a result, Jefferies cut its FY26 to FY28 earnings per share estimates by 19 to 21%.HSBC also downgraded Cipla to 'Hold' and reduced its price target to ₹1,285.The brokerage said weaker gRevlimid sales in the December quarter led to a sharp decline in profitability, prompting management to lower FY26 EBITDA margin guidance to 21% from the earlier range of 22.75 to 24%.HSBC added that execution will remain critical for Cipla to navigate challenges such as the Lanreotide supply disruption and restore operational stability. The resolution of Lanreotide supply issues remains a key monitorable, the brokerage said.Macquarie maintained an 'Outperform' rating on Cipla with a price target of ₹1,490, but acknowledged that the company's revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted PAT missed its estimates by 6%, 26% and 23%, respectively.The brokerage said that management has lowered its FY26 EBITDA margin guidance to 21% and also signalled a potential downgrade to FY27 US revenue guidance.However, Macquarie believes the recent correction in the stock price already factors in most of the near-term headwinds.Shares of Cipla Ltd. ended 3.51% lower last Friday during the market sell-off at ₹1,322.30.

This move stops fresh investments while allowing existing investors to remain in the schemes.What is happening?The fund house has halted all new lump-sum subscriptions, new SIPs, STPs, and switch-ins in the two schemes.Transactions submitted on or before 3:00 pm on January 23 will be processed at the applicable NAV.Existing investors can continue to redeem or switch out units without restrictions.Why is this happening?The Securities and Exchange Board of India  recently updated regulations for Fund-of-Fund schemes. The two ICICI Prudential FoFs do not fit into any of the new categories.Grandfathering ensures that the schemes remain available for current investors but cannot take in new money.What does ‘grandfathering’ mean?Grandfathering allows a fund to continue its operations for existing investors even if it no longer complies with new regulations.Fresh investments are barred, but current investors can stay invested, redeem, or switch funds at any time.Typically, the schemes are wound up or merged within a few years after grandfathering.What investors should knowInvestors in these schemes should: \tMonitor redemption or switch timelines if they wish to exit. Stay informed about future merger or winding-up plans from the fund house.Grandfathering protects existing investors while ensuring compliance with SEBI’s updated rules.",

        "condensed_text": "Paytm share price target cut by Jefferies but 'buy' rating maintained; Here's why. Brokerage firm Jefferies has cut its price target on One97 Communications, parent company of payments aggregator Paytm to ₹1,450 from ₹1,600 in its latest note on Tuesday, January 27.The revised price target implies an upside potential of 25% from current levels.Paytm shares fell over 8% on Friday after there has been no update on the Payments Infrastructure Development Fund  being extended by the Reserve Bank of India, after its deadline ended on December 31.In response, Paytm had highlighted that even if the scheme is not extended, it will mitigate this impact by other revenue sources.For the first half of the current financial year, Paytm earned ₹128 crore as incentive through this scheme, which was launched in January 2021 to promote the deployment of payment acceptance infrastructure, such as PoS terminals and QR codes, particularly in tier-3 to tier-6 towns. That figure contributed to 46% of Paytm's adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation .Jefferies had projected this incentive figure to reach ₹280 crore in financial year 2027 and financial year 2028, which it has now removed from its estimates and partly compensated it with a hike in device subscription fee by 6% to 7% from 3% earlier, and some cost controls.\"It can also control opex to manage profit impact, especially sales staff or incentives in the relevant markets,\" Jefferies wrote in its note.This will result in Paytm's Adjusted EBITDA declining by 8% to 14%, thereby resulting in a cut to the price target.However, despite these headwinds, Jefferies has maintained its \"buy\" recommendation on Paytm, as the brokerage believes that the business fundamentals continue to remain strong with new revenue lines opening up.Shares of Paytm, after the 8% fall on Friday to ₹1,155, are down 16% from their recent 52-week high level of ₹1,381.",

        "condensed_text": "Gokaldas Exports on India-EU trade deal — Top key takeaways. Gokaldas Exports, a key textile player in India and a major exporter to the US and the European Union, welcomed the Free Trade Agreement between India and the European Union, stating that it is a positive step for Indian textile and apparel players.In an interaction with CNBC-TV18 on Tuesday, January 27, Gokaldas Exports' Vice Chairman and Managing Director Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi said that the step is significant as both the US and European Union are big markets for Indian textile players.Here are some of the key takeaways from the management interaction:Exposure To The European UnionCurrently, Gokaldas Exports continues to derive a major revenue share from the US market. Its exposure to the European Union stands between 16% to 17% of its annual topline.Over the next 12 months, Ganapathi is confident that the figure will increase to between 19% to 20% of the overall topline.Capacity, Capex and MarginsThe entire Gokaldas Export capacity is currently operating at full potential, according to its Vice Chairman and MD.Although he intends to go slow on the capex front, considering the 50% tariffs on US exports still continuing, he plans on making further investments in the European Union, once the deal begins to fructify in 2027.As a result of this FTA, Gokaldas Exports also expects margins to improve on exports to the geography.Impact Of US TariffsDespite the 50% tariffs on exports to the US, Gokaldas Exports' order book pipeline for the US is strong till the first quarter of financial year 2027, according to Ganapathi, who also went on to add that orders are coming in for the second quarter as well.While the company's order book may not have seen a significant impact, margins at the EBITDA level are taking a hit.Margins for US exports have now fallen to low-single-digits due to the US tariffs, while the overall margins are expected to remain in the \"high-single-digit\" range.Gokaldas Exports is yet to declare its results for the December quarter, which will be the first full quarter for the company with the 50% tariff on US exports.Under the India-EU FTA, India's exports of marine products, chemicals, textiles, footwear, consumer goods, base metals and sporting goods will have \"zero tariffs.\"Shares of Gokaldas Exports fell 7.5% during last Friday's sell-off, and have halved from their recent 52-week high of ₹1,060.",

ICICI Direct said that EBITDA per tonne improved by 5.7 per cent YoY to Rs 1,007, aided by cost-saving measures such as increasing the share of green power, which rose to approximately 42 per cent during the quarter.",

On IndusInd Bank, Nirmal Bang said the lender's Q3 performance was better than its expectations at NII level by 7.5 per cent and lower than its expectations by 13.2 per cent on PPOP and by 85.5 per cent at PAT level. It estimated an earnings CAGR of 23.3 per cent for IndusInd Bank over FY25-FY28E mainly due to improvement in cost ratios and credit costs. \"In our view, IIB will see an overhang in the near-to-medium term due to: (1) De-growth in loan book, and (2) Higher credit costs in the unsecured loan segment.

        "condensed_text": "Nuvama Institutional Equities said core PPOP (pre-provision operating profit) increased 12 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) but declined 36 per cent year-on-year (YoY), while reported standalone PPOP rose 14 per cent QoQ and fell 36 per cent YoY. The brokerage noted that achieving this target would depend on a decline in slippages, alongside the bank's aspiration to reduce net non-performing assets (NPA) to 0.6 per cent from 1 per cent. On expectations that earnings have bottomed, Nuvama raised its target price to Rs 900, valuing the bank at 1x book value, from Rs 600 earlier, and upgraded the rating to 'HOLD' from 'REDUCE'. The bank is working on a three-year plan called PACE to strengthen its franchise in vehicles, corporate and rural segments, deepen its focus on small and medium enterprises, enhance customer centricity, and improve execution efficiency. Despite these factors, Elara said the bank has navigated its crucial phase better, leading it to raise its target multiple to 1x from 0.8x and increase its target price to Rs 910 from Rs 720, while revising its rating to 'Reduce' from 'Sell'.",

        "condensed_text": "Between March 2032 and March 2035, the yearly outgo will be trimmed to ₹ 100 crore, Vodafone Idea said in a stock exchange filing, citing a communication received from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Despite this relief, analysts expect a muted performance from Vodafone Idea in the December quarter of the fiscal year 2025-26 (Q3FY26) with flattish revenue growth likely on subscriber losses offset by growth in the average revenue per user (ARPU). Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE) estimate a 1.3% year-on-year (YoY) rise in revenue to ₹ 11,261.1 crore, with losses seen rising to ₹ 6763.9 crore during the quarter under review. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, said investors need to approach Vodafone Idea with caution rather than expectation; the stock has seen bouts of speculative interest ahead of results in the past, but the underlying fundamentals remain fragile. Meanwhile, on technical parameters, Vodafone Idea Limited has broken below its critical support at 10.47, confirming a clear structural failure on higher timeframes, opined Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments.",

        "condensed_text": "Shares of India’s top carmakers like Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M), Maruti Suzuki India , Tata Motors and Hyundai fell up to 5% on Tuesday amid fears that the India EU FTA, which is scheduled to be signed later in the day, may see slashing of tariffs on cars imported from Europe. Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra fell as much as 5.1% to their lowest level since August 2025, leading losses on the Nifty auto index , which was down 2.2%. Live Events European carmakers currently hold a less than 4% share of India’s 4.4 million units a year car market, which is dominated by Japan’s Suzuki Motor, as well as homegrown brands Mahindra and Tata, which together hold two thirds of the market. Emkay Global analysts said if the India EU Free Trade Agreement is similar to the India UK FTA, duty revision would have minimal or no impact on Indian PV OEMs, as CBU imports are restricted to super luxury models priced between Rs 1 crore and Rs 1.5 crore. “A potential reduction in the around 8% import duty on motorcycles in the EU from India would be a positive for key two wheeler exporters like Bajaj Auto (KTM and Triumph) and TVS Motor (BMW and Norton), as EU markets levy country specific VAT on bike value and duty, amplifying effective landed cost,” Emkay said.",

According to Jefferies, the key reason behind the earnings downgrade is the non renewal of the RBI’s Payments Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) scheme, which earlier supported digital payment infrastructure in underbanked regions. Jefferies had earlier factored in Rs 2.8 billion of incentive income for both FY27 and FY28, accounting for 19% and 12% of adjusted EBITDA, respectively. To partly offset the impact, Jefferies expects Paytm to raise device subscription fees by 6 to 7%, higher than its earlier assumption of 3%, and implement cost controls, particularly in sales and incentive related expenses.

All these will have an impact on the cement industry, and obviously, there is reason to pass on these cost escalations into prices.”\nBrokerage firm Choice Broking has maintained its ‘buy’ rating on the UltraTech Cement stock, with a target price of ₹ 15,210, suggesting an upside potential of up to 23%. We continue to be positive on UTCEM owing to: 1) Ambitious and continuous capacity expansion plan to add ~8 Mnt of capacity in Q4FY26 and 12 Mnt of capacity in FY27E, 2) Funding expansion outlay largely via internal accruals, 3) Proactive cost-optimisation strategy, 4) Favourable sectoral pricing environment and 5) Significant demand growth is expected from the southern market. Our EV to CE (Enterprise Value to Capital Employed)-based framework allows us a rational basis to assign a valuation multiple which captures improving fundamentals (ROCE expansion by 726 bps over FY25–28E),” the firm said in a note. Meanwhile, brokerage firm JM Financial has also maintained its ‘buy’ rating on the stock with revised target price of ₹ 14,500, saying that the company reported a strong 3QFY26 earnings performance with consolidated EBITDA rising 35% YoY/27% QoQ to ₹ 39.2 billion, beating estimates by 8–13% primarily due to lower-than-estimated cost/tn.",

At the test-of-cure visit, Foviscu achieved a high clinical cure rate of 93.23% vs 92.31% with meropenem, thereby meeting the primary endpoint and demonstrating therapeutic equivalence with a similarly well-tolerated safety profile,\" Wockhardt said.This is the first phase 3 head-to-head trial of an antibiotic specifically developed for extended spectrum lactamase  infections compared with meropenem, it added.As per the Indian Council of Medical Research  data, a high burden of ESBLs and rising resistance to commonly-used antibiotics such as piperacillin/tazobactam and ceforperazon/sulbactam, increasingly forcing clinicians to rely on carbapenems and thereby accelerating carbapenem resistance, Wockhardt said.By providing an effective alternative, Foviscu has the potential to reduce carbapenem use and strengthen antibiotic stewardship to curb antimicrobial resistance, it added. At present around 65 lakh treatment courses of meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefoperazone/sulbactam are used annually in India.Shares of Wockhardt Ltd. were trading 1.2% up at ₹1,368 apiece around 10.40 am.

The company’s focus on product mix optimisation has helped cushion margins despite cost pressures and global uncertainty.According to Acharya, JSW Steel is now well positioned for its next phase of growth, driven by organic capacity expansion, improved performance at overseas operations and the value unlock from its proposed joint venture with JFE Steel at the BPSL asset.In October-December quarter , JSW Steel reported revenue of ₹45,991 crore, net profit of ₹2,410 crore and margins of 14.1%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: How is steel demand panning out in India as well as globally? India is doing quite well.We see the quarter four to be seasonally strong from a demand standpoint, and we are well placed to take advantage of the demand in India.Q: Demand in India is sounding quite optimistic and to be fair, the central government as well has given a good amount of assistance because duties have been put in place to protect the domestic steel industry post which there have been price increases. Can you quantify what is the cost of coal increase that you are working with for the coming quarter?A: From a price point of view, the prices started, if I take hot rolled as an example of flat products, the prices started moving from the second half of December, and we saw an increase of about ₹1,500 in December and about ₹2,000 in the beginning of January.If you look at the coking coal cost in the last quarter, the coking coal cost went up by about $5 and we had guided between $3 to $5 and that's where we have been. The asset has potential to grow from the current 4.50 million tonnes to 10 and beyond.This unlock of value will help us to grow both the BPSL asset and the JSW Steel expansions parallelly and that will be growth accretive for the JSW shareholders and stakeholders at large.Q: You have been focusing a lot on the organic growth side, and you have already said you will be more than 50 million tonnes on, but you all have mentioned a line on inorganic growth.",

        "condensed_text": "Granules India’s revenue and profit growth over the rest of the fiscal year 2025-26  and into 2026-27  will largely depend on the outcome of its ongoing remediation process with the US Food and Drug Administration , Executive Director Priyanka Chigurupati said.The company expects the January-March 2026 quarter to be stronger as capacity utilisation improves, while the launch of 10–13 pending products could drive a sharper pickup in growth once regulatory clearance is received.Granules India has been shifting its product mix toward complex generics, including treatments for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , oncology and other specialised therapies, as part of its long-term strategy.The company reported a 27.7% year-on-year rise in net profit to ₹150.2 crore for the October–December 2025 quarter, compared with ₹117.6 crore a year earlier, according to its stock exchange filing.Granules India currently has a market capitalisation of ₹14,026.25 crore. So, in terms of the outlook, it really depends on what the FDA thinks of our remediation activities, and if they want, they can come as soon as tomorrow or a few months down the line, but we do expect them to come for everyone to move forward.But that said, I continue to say that our existing products, we haven't seen any dip in performance; we continue to gain share in most of the products that we already have approved. What will this be used for?A: The money that we're raising through the warrants issue and the primary infusion is primarily to strengthen our balance sheet, because we are looking at some potential opportunities, inorganic opportunities, and nothing concrete yet.But if you look at our portfolio evolution and our strategy evolution over the last couple of quarters and last couple of years, it's been playing out well, where the percentage of what we call our integrated generics versus complex generics has gone down, so the complex version has gone up, which means that our strategy of our ADHD controlled substance strategy, our oncology strategy, our complex product strategy, has been playing out pretty well. So, we are looking at growth within the complex generics range, and that's why we want to strengthen our balance sheet in case a great opportunity comes our way.Q: So, the fundraiser is not to accelerate deleveraging, but rather to look at inorganic opportunities in complex generics.A: I just want to correct that it is to strengthen the balance sheet. And we also got tentative approval for another product, generic Dayvigo, through which we're eligible for a potential first-to-file opportunity, and that has an addressable market size of $41 million.So, the number of organic R&amp;D filings in the complex itself is going to go up quite significantly, with a good target for this year and the upcoming year.",

Aurionpro Solutions Limited on Tuesday, January 27, said it has secured a multi-year order from Titagarh Rail Systems Limited for the design, supply, commissioning and long-term maintenance of Platform Screen Door  systems for Mumbai Metro Line 5.Aurionpro, in an exchange filing, said the engagement is one of the largest multi-million-dollar deals in its Smart Transit portfolio and will be executed in consortium with KTK Group Co. Ltd. The order marks Aurionpro’s entry into safety-critical automatic PSD solutions, expanding its end-to-end urban mobility offerings in India’s rapidly growing metro rail market.The win is also Aurionpro’s first collaboration with Titagarh Rail Systems and builds on the company’s existing footprint in Mumbai’s metro network, following earlier orders for Metro Lines 4 and 4A awarded by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority.Sanjay Bali, President – Tech Innovation Group at Aurionpro, said, \"Driven by sustained investments in R&amp;D, Aurionpro has built a strong portfolio of innovative offerings in the smart transit space, complemented by state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities at our Ghaziabad facility under AuroToshi, our subsidiary aligned with the Make in India initiative. \"According to Aurionpro, the addition of PSD systems broadens its addressable market across metro rail, railways and BRTS applications, while enhancing passenger safety, station comfort and operational efficiency, particularly for high-traffic and automated metro networks.Earlier this month, the company had secured a fresh order from Delhi Metro Rail Corporation  Limited, valued at around ₹150 crore, to implement Automated Fare Collection  systems for the Bhopal and Indore Metro projects.Aurionpro Solutions aims to become a top-three global player in its core technology segments by 2030, expecting to sustain its strong growth momentum of about 32–33% CAGR since the fiscal year 2020-21 . CEO Ashish Rai earlier said that maintaining this pace could help the company reach ₹5,000 crore in revenue by fiscal year 2029-30 .Following the announcement, shares of the company were trading 2.58% up at ₹938.60 as of 12.42 pm, down from the intraday highs of ₹953.60.",

        "condensed_text": "With lower tax rates and stabilising oil prices, Malbari expressed confidence that demand conditions should improve in the March quarter and strengthen further into the next financial year.Looking ahead, Malbari highlighted that Godrej Consumer Products remains focused on building a sustainable growth trajectory by expanding new-age categories, gaining market share in household insecticides, and scaling up home and fabric care products.Internationally, while Indonesia remains range-bound, the company expects growth to return from FY27, supported by green shoots in volumes, alongside continued strong momentum in Africa, the US and the Middle East.In the October–December quarter , Godrej Consumer Products reported revenue of ₹4,099 crore, profit after tax of ₹498 crore, and margins of 21.5%.With margins expected to stay within a healthy band, the company aims to steadily move closer to its long-term aspiration of double-digit volume growth.This is the edited excerpt of the interview.Q: Could you give us a sense on demand environment and how that has been post the entire GST transition, and whether quarter four will be a lot better than quarter three where you displayed about 9% volume growth.A: From a demand environment perspective, broadly the environment has remained same over the last couple of quarters. The primary category which has been impacted has been soaps for us, but with the lower GST rate, reasonably confident that we should see a sequential improvement in the demand condition for soaps into quarter four and going into next year.There are two pieces which will benefit the soaps category - one is the lower GST rate and second is some kind of normalisation in the oil prices. I do see sequential improvement in the demand conditions, and hence we should see some bit of, I would say, growth improvement going forward as we go along.Q: Would you be able to put a number though to that incremental growth that you are talking about?A: By and large, we have been delivering, on a year-to-date basis, growths which are in the range of 6%-7% band this quarter has been exceptional. Hence, we do believe that the margin story is sustainable, and we should be able to kind of sustain range bound, margin journey between 24% to 26%.Again, we typically kind of hold our margin guidance for the year, because from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, depending on the investments you are doing, depending on launch plans, they do kind of fluctuate. We also guided in our press note that we do see margin stay in quarter four again in these levels of range bound, and from there on, we should be able to build.Given that our focus has been in terms of driving a profitable growth, the idea, more than margin, is to kind of ensure that we kind of drive topline and, wherever we get savings, we do kind of invest them in terms of building new category TAMs and we do kind of, I would say, a measured margin improvement.Q: Should we expect double digit volume growth shortly, maybe two or three quarters away.A: The idea is to sequentially, kind of build from where we are.",

Revenue rose 8.8% QoQ to ₹757.5 crore from ₹696 crore.EBITDA stood at ₹91.2 crore during the quarter, marginally lower than ₹91.7 crore in Q2FY26, while operating margins declined to 12% from 13.2% sequentially.On a year-on-year basis, total income surged 56% to ₹766 crore in Q3 FY26 from ₹492 crore in the same quarter last year, reflecting healthy demand and strong execution across projects.Commenting on the performance, Managing Director and CEO Harmohan Sahni said, “We delivered strong revenue growth during the quarter, reflecting healthy demand and successful execution of our new launches. Margins were temporarily impacted by upfront approval and marketing costs, which are essential investments to build scale and sustain long-term growth.”He added that as projects mature, operating leverage is expected to drive a steady improvement in profitability.Raymond Realty continues to scale its Thane land parcel, with around 55 acres currently under development, translating into approximately 5.8 million square feet of RERA carpet area and a potential revenue of about ₹13,200 crore. Of this, the company has already sold around ₹8,500 crore and collected approximately ₹6,700 crore.The company is set to launch two additional projects in the coming quarter, including a TenX residential development focused on 2-BHK homes and a high-street retail project, aimed at strengthening and diversifying its portfolio.For the first nine months of FY26, Raymond Realty reported booking value of ₹1,504 crore and customer collections of ₹1,210 crore.

Basumallick said once India has a lot more a Mercedes or BMW etc on the Indian roads, the possibilities of those companies setting up their own supply chains, their own manufacturing base here would rise in the long-term. India’s export basket with the EU too has moved up the value chain with time, with high-value exports (electronics, machinery, chemicals) gaining share over traditional labor-intensive goods (textiles, jewellery, footwear). \"Even as India forms only 0.8 per cent EU’s export market, the deal is essential for the EU as well, amid its rapidly widening trade deficit with India— $15 billion deficit in FY25 vs $3 billion surplus in FY19—and need to diversify its trade pie away from the China+1 playbook. \"Our quick assessments suggest that in case of a full-fledged and strong FTA deal, India’s goods export surplus from the EU could increase by $50 billion by FY31, with EU’s share jumping to 22-23 per cent from 17.3 per cent now.",

The company has also taken approval from shareholders and its board to raise up to ₹10,000 crore, if required, to ensure the timely commissioning of projects.JSW Energy reported a net profit of ₹420 crore for the October-December 2025 quarter of fiscal year 2025-26 , compared with ₹168 crore a year earlier, marking a 2.5-fold increase, driven by higher power generation and contributions from recently acquired assets.The company currently has a market capitalisation of ₹75,372.51 crore. There, we have realised, as compared to the merchant price average of ₹3.22, our realisations have been almost 20% higher, and that is because of the strategic short-term tie-ups, which we have done with some of the distribution companies  and states that need power at this point.So that is a proactive approach we have been taking historically, and we continue to do that. Regarding the capital requirement, the funding, you can see that at quarter three end, we have shown in our books that we have free cash of almost in excess of ₹7,000 crore, which gives us a big cushion to continue with our capex plan.But as and when required, we have taken the enabling approval from the shareholders as well as the board for raising capital up to ₹10,000 crore, as and when required, to ensure that our timely commissioning of the capacities is there, and funding is not a constraint for us.Also Read | Sona BLW CEO says Europe capex push and supplier stress could benefit Indian auto firmsQ: Funding is not a constraint.

Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd  and Castrol India have signed a Memorandum of Understanding  to explore the development of a re-refined base oil  ecosystem in India, the companies said on Tuesday, January 27. The partnership will evaluate a circular model for collecting used lubricating oil and re-refining it for reuse in lubricant manufacturing as India looks to improve waste management and reduce reliance on virgin base oils.Under the agreement, the two companies will assess the commercial, operational and technical feasibility of scaling such a model, including mapping used oil collection channels, reviewing re-refining capacity and testing RRBO across lubricant formulations.“As energy markets transition, circularity in value chains will become increasingly important,” said Ch Srinivas, Executive Director for Lubes at HPCL. He further said that the initiative aims to recover material value while promoting responsible resource use.Castrol India’s interim CEO Saugata Basuray said used oil could be a valuable resource if processed correctly and that the collaboration could help reduce waste and environmental impact.Castrol India, in a regulatory exchange, highlighted that India generates large volumes of used lubricating oil annually with much of it either under-collected or disposed of through informal channels. International studies show that re-refining used oil can recover up to 70–80% of it as high-quality base oil while consuming significantly less energy than refining crude-based alternatives, the company said, adding that assessment work will begin immediately, with findings expected to guide the next phase of the initiative.Shares of Castrol India is trading at ₹183.90 apiece on the BSE, which is 0.08% higher than the day's opening.Also Read: Raymond Lifestyle Q3 Results: Stock surges nearly 6% after strong operational performance",

Markets are looking promising, and as and when they find new markets stabilised, the credit offtake will improve.Also Read | Granules India expects better March quarter; US FDA decision crucial for FY27 growthQ: So when you speak about the Budget and some improvement on your construction equipment portfolio on account of some of the announcements in infrastructure, could you detail what exactly you'd be watching out for, and how much of an improvement can we see in FY27 over the kind of performance that we see in FY26, especially as this large money also flows in, that is sure to boost some of your growth for the business?A: Infrastructure spending by the government will have multiple positive impacts for us, not only in construction equipment, but also in heavy commercial vehicles, because heavy commercial vehicles are mostly dependent on large transportation like cement and steel. Many of our customers who remain with us for 10 to 15 years then move to the competition or the bank when they want to upgrade themselves to buy a new vehicle, because new vehicles have a higher ticket size, and when they buy an asset of a higher ticket size, they would like to have competitive rates.And we would like to retain those customers, because we have a very large number of customers. We have given a long-term guidance of 8.5% to 9%, because some of the benefits, which will come to us ,will be passed on to the customer, especially to retain customers for buying new vehicles.So, there will be some range-bound situation as far as the net interest margin is concerned, and benefiting the customer also is one part of it.Q: So the MUFG deal closure timeline — that was the other question.A: It should be by the financial year-end. The process of application to the regulator and the CCA is in progress, and once we get approval, we should close it by the financial year-end.Q: With a lot more capital coming at your disposal right now, with a lot of scale, the fear is that you may disrupt the industry by growing a lot faster, or maybe giving loans at prices which will be a lot more attractive as against competitors.",

The rally may have ignited by the government's confirmation that import duties on Indian marine products entering the EU, currently standing at a steep 26%, will be slashed to zero under the new pact. According to the company's investor presentation for Q2 FY26, the European Union (EU) market commands a massive 46% share of the company's sales mix for the first half of the fiscal year.

        "condensed_text": "After a relatively softer growth in the first nine months, the company expects the final quarter to deliver the bulk of revenues, in line with the broader trend seen across defence manufacturers.Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Amit Mahajan, Director at Paras Defence and Space Technologies, said the company remains firmly on track to deliver revenue growth of 30–40% for the full year, supported by strong execution momentum and a robust pipeline of defence and space-related orders. Management expects FY26 revenues to close in the range of ₹450–500 crore, with the March quarter contributing the highest share.Looking ahead, Paras Defence sees its order book strengthening further over the next few months, driven by demand across optics, optical systems, laser-based solutions, ground-to-space telescopes and defence electronics.With order inflows expected to accelerate into FY27 and margins set to improve on the back of high-value execution, the company remains optimistic about sustaining growth while expanding profitability in defence and space technologies.In the October–December quarter , Paras Defence reported revenue of ₹106 crore, net profit of ₹17 crore, and margins of 24.65%.Below are the edited excerpts of the interview.Q: Your revenue growth this nine-month period, you have not seen the growth that you are envisaging for the full year. What is it that one could expect in terms of the guidance for FY26 would you want to lower the guidance for the full year?A: The quarter one, quarter two, quarter three, we are on course for minimum growth of 30% and we will continue to keep our guidance to 30 to 40%, because the quarter four which is where we are into, is the most happening quarter in all the defence companies and we are on it for a good growth.Q: Can you just elaborate a little more, what exactly are you expecting? So there are certain some things that get spill over to the next year, but 5% here and there, I don't think is a big cut down.Q: Just to reiterate, your closing the year with ₹450 crores?A: Yes.Q: But the earlier guidance was around ₹511 crores so we are working with maybe a lesser amount now?A: We are looking still at between ₹450 to 500 crores per se.Q: What is the order inflow looking like for you in FY27, if you could give us more colour in terms of the kind of orders that you bid for, and what we will hear from the company in terms of order wins, say in quarter four as well as say, maybe going into quarter one?A: We are looking at orders coming in for the optics and optical systems, majorly, and those orders are related to, say, a laser system. Is that something you will sustain, and given that execution we're expecting will be more in this quarter four period as well then Are these high margin execution orders that you will see?A: The margins will improve than what we have seen till now, and you are right, between 27 to 30% on an EBITDA level, and PAT between seven, between 18 to 20% is what we are expecting.For the entire discussion, watch the accompanying video",

And the way next year is looking, it will be roughly in the range of 25,000 to 30,000 seat additions for next year as well, a lot of them driven by some strong back-to-back deals that we've won over the last few quarters, as well as our expansion of WeWork-branded spaces that we continue to see a lot of demand for.Capacity addition has been roughly in the 20% range, and it will continue to accelerate at that pace, even for next year.Q: You have plans to take your total capacity to somewhere around 11.4 million square feet over a period of time.

By the end of the next financial year, we aim to continue to keep net debt at zero, even as we may raise some small debt for some of this capex financing.Also Read | JSW Energy on track for 15 GW capacity by FY26-end, plans ₹10,000 crore fundraise if neededQ: Just wanted to get more of an idea with regard to what you are doing in the luxury property space.

At ICICI Prudential Life, bancassurance grew 10.5 percent year-on-year in Q3 FY26, contributing 26.7 percent to APE, which is a relatively lower number compared to the previous quarters for the company, with ICICI Bank continuing to deliver steady volumes.",

        "condensed_text": "The fund house has reopened subscriptions in its small-cap funds and select international schemes, signalling renewed confidence in market opportunities.Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Chintan Haria, Principal – Investment Strategy at ICICI Prudential AMC, which manages assets worth nearly $3.03 billion, said that while Indian equities have been strong performers over the past year and a half, recent market corrections have improved the risk-reward balance for long-term investors.He said valuations are not as cheap as past crisis periods, but the current phase offers a reasonable entry point for investors starting their equity journey, based on their asset allocation needs.Haria pointed out that market participation has broadened significantly. He said value is emerging in large-cap and mega-cap stocks that have underperformed over the last year.From a sectoral perspective, ICICI Prudential AMC is watching energy, financials and technology closely. These sectors have seen meaningful underperformance despite stable fundamentals.Low crude oil prices have led to a correction in oil and gas stocks, while foreign investor selling has weighed on financials, even as earnings remain steady. Technology stocks have also lagged, creating selective opportunities.The AMC has also reopened select international funds, including its Strategic Metals and Energy Fund. He added that these funds can be considered either as part of equity allocation or as an alternative to gold exposure.On global investing, Haria said international diversification remains important, especially as currency movements, inflation risks and global commodity trends continue to evolve.For full interview, watch accompanying video",

        "condensed_text": "Investec has reiterated its positive stance on One 97 Communications , the parent of Paytm , highlighting the company’s expanding “digital toll road” across payments and merchant services as a key long-term growth driver. According to the brokerage, Paytm is well placed to benefit from rising credit-linked payments, strong operating leverage and oligopolistic market structures, and it forecasts a 23 per cent revenue CAGR with EBITDA margins expanding to 24 per cent by FY28, prompting a buy rating on the stock at ₹1,550 target price (a 35 per cent upside potential from current levels). Another brokerage JM Financial said Paytm’s stock recently corrected sharply after market worries emerged over the status of the Payment Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) incentive, following references in a draft prospectus filed by a private player. JM Financial believes Paytm could deploy offsetting measures such as higher monetisation and tighter sales execution, reducing the potential earnings impact to about 11 per cent in FY27 and 5 per cent in FY28. On Friday, One 97 Communications said the company had recognised incentives under the RBI’s scheme for qualifying expenditure on deploying payment acceptance devices such as soundboxes and EDC machines, particularly in Tier-3 to Tier-6 centres, the north-eastern states and the Union Territories of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.",

Net profit is projected to increase 6.6 percent YoY to Rs 5,023.7 crore, compared with Rs 4,711 crore in the year-ago quarter, supported by improved operating leverage. Regulated cost-plus model limits earnings volatility\nDespite weaker generation, NTPC’s earnings are expected to remain relatively stable due to its regulated business framework, under which returns are linked to regulated equity rather than volumes. Motilal Oswal expects ~8% YoY growth in revenue and EBITDA and ~7% growth in adjusted PAT, while Antique noted that lower PLFs have limited impact on profitability under the cost-plus structure.

The lower-than-expected drop in net profit can be attributed to a decline in expenses, which stood at ₹ 17,884 crore compared with ₹ 17,974 crore in the same period last year. The company’s revenue from operations increased 2% year-on-year and 1.15% quarter-on-quarter to ₹ 11,323 crore, also surpassing Bloomberg’s estimate of ₹ 11,297 crore. Abhijit Kishore, CEO, Vodafone Idea Limited, said \"This quarter marked an important inflection point for the company with positive resolution of key legacy issues. After the AGR dues freeze, the telecom company’s total outgo towards AGR payments over the next six years from March 2026 to March 2031 would be ₹ 744 crore, a maximum of ₹ 124 crore per year.",

The smelter expansion at Aditya Aluminium will also mark a step forward in energy transition, with a portion of its power requirement planned to be met through round-the-clock renewable energy, integrating sustainability considerations into large-scale industrial growth. Hindalco's presence in Odisha spans over 15 years during which it has already invested more than Rs 25,000 crore across bauxite mining, alumina refining, primary aluminium smelting, and downstream manufacturing. The broader investment pipeline includes the FRP and battery foil manufacturing facilities, the primary aluminium smelter expansion, Kansariguda alumina refinery, Meenakshi coal mine, specialised materials such as white fused alumina, and ancillary manufacturing units, further consolidating Odisha's status as a national hub for aluminium excellence.",

There’s a lot of potential in critical minerals, also small modular reactors and a lot of our companies which started off as traditional oil companies have moved to green energy,” Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri said. Recognizing that there exists a huge potential for cooperation in clean energy value chains, the two sides noted the opportunities for collaboration in renewable energy, including hydrogen, biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel; battery storage; critical minerals; clean technologies; electricity systems; energy supply chain resilience, and the application of artificial intelligence in the energy sector. Canada has stated its goal of becoming an energy superpower in clean and conventional energy, with export diversification as a priority while India offers a natural and symbiotic partnership grounded in scale, stability, and long-term opportunity, the government said. Canada has current and emerging liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, is increasing production and exports of crude oil to markets in Asia via the Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) Pipeline and is advancing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) exports to Asia via the west coast of Canada.",

Once the FTA is ratified, European carmakers stand to gain easier access to the world’s third-largest car market, allowing them to introduce more premium models under a calibrated liberalisation framework—an opportunity for EU brands, but one that could add competition for Indian manufacturers, according to Moody’s Ratings. Greater tariff certainty and a more predictable trade framework will allow us to evaluate the introduction of a wider range of European models for Indian customers,” said Piyush Arora, Managing Director and CEO of Škoda Auto Volkswagen India. “We have always advocated free trade as it enhances fair market access, strengthens economic collaboration, leverages mutual strengths, and builds more resilient supply chains, especially at a time when such cooperation is more critical than ever,” said Brar. “The proposed phased reduction of tariffs on cars and auto components has the potential to positively impact consumer confidence, enable greater product choice, and foster technological innovation and sustainable growth within the Indian automotive sector, particularly in future mobility,” Brar added.",

The divergence points to narrowing market breadth, with investors booking profits in sectors that had delivered outsized gains over the past two years and trimming exposure to higher-risk segments amid volatile foreign flows and muted earnings momentum. The correction has been a result of valuation de-rating, with higher risk premiums being assigned amid muted earnings momentum and macro uncertainty, while sustained FII outflows and limited domestic participation deepened the selloff, Fenil Brahmbhatt, Analyst – Realty, Choice Institutional Equities said. New project launches slowed in Q3, while demand shifted toward premium and luxury homes, leading to lower unit volumes but higher overall sales value,” he said, adding that the sector continues to attract capital and investor interest over the long term.

Kumar said that since BP mobilised in April, the production decline has been stabilised, with ONGC adding around 3,500-4,000 barrels of oil per day and 2-2.5 million standard cubic meters per day (MSCMD) natural gas over the minimum baseline. In its FY25 annual report, ONGC said that the CPSU will focus on enhancing production from mature assets, fast-tracking recent discoveries and deepening its TSP strategy in FY26, which ends in March this year.",

        "condensed_text": "Shares of Asian Paints Ltd., India's largest paints maker, are trading 6% lower on Wednesday, January 28, following a mixed set of brokerage reactions to its December quarter earnings.The company said unseasonal rains and a shorter festive season weighed on performance during the quarter.Brokerage firm CLSA has maintained its 'Underperform' rating on Asian Paints with a price target of ₹1,875.The brokerage said that consolidated revenue growth of 3.7% came in about 2% below its expectations. Standalone volume growth stood at 7.9% year-on-year, aided by a weak base and in line with an earlier festive season.While near-term guidance points to mid-single-digit value growth and high single-digit volume growth, CLSA said the gap between revenue and volume growth remains a concern.Its gross margin was much better than expected, aided by softer commodity costs and some operating leverage.CLSA cut its FY26-28 earnings estimates by 0-7% to reflect this divergence.HSBC downgraded the stock to 'Hold' and reduced its price target to ₹2,900.The brokerage flagged disappointing volume and revenue growth in Q3 and warned that weaker retail demand trends could persist for longer. Although margins were strong, HSBC said much of the benefit is already built into FY26 estimates, with downside risks emerging for FY27.Goldman Sachs has a 'Sell' rating, and a price target of ₹2,500.The brokerage said the company's Q3 performance came in below estimates, with India decorative growth remaining weak despite a favourable base.It also cited muted demand commentary, noting that value growth is likely to remain in the mid-single-digit range in the near term.Goldman added that margins are currently at the higher end of the guidance band, but any further improvement is likely to be reinvested back into the business.Citi also maintained a 'Sell' rating on Asian Paints with a price target of ₹2,300. The brokerage cut its FY26-28 revenue estimates by 3%, citing slower-than-expected growth momentum.On the other hand, Jefferies retained its 'Buy' rating with a price target of ₹3,300.It said domestic volume growth moderated due to seasonal factors but remained respectable at around 8% year-on-year. Gross margins were at a multi-quarter high, while operating margins were at the higher end of the guidance band and are likely to sustain.Nomura said that near-term guidance of mid-single-digit value growth and double-digit volume growth may not excite the Street, despite margin resilience.Asian Paints is currently trading at about 47 times its March 2028 forward earnings.Shares of Asian Paints ended 2.8% lower on Tuesday at ₹2,628 following the earnings announcement.",

        "condensed_text": "Tata Motors CV shares still have more upside in store; UBS says 'buy'. Brokerage firm UBS is positive on commercial vehicle makers as it has initiated coverage on Tata Motors Ltd. and raised its target price on Ashok Leyland Ltd.UBS has initiated a \"buy\" rating on Tata Motor CV with a price target of ₹550 per share, implying a potential upside of 23.65% from its previous close. It has a \"buy\" rating on Ashok Leyland as well and has raised its price target by 92.3% to ₹225 from ₹117, indicating a potential upside of 16.4% from its previous close.UBS believes that investors may be overlooking the structural strengths of the commercial vehicle sector compared to two-wheelers and cars.Globally, commercial vehicle stocks command premium valuations due to consolidation, healthy cash flows and lower technological or regulatory risks, it said.While these factors are present in India, UBS is of the view that commercial vehicle stocks still trade at a discount, largely because of past concerns regarding volume and margin volatility.However, since the financial year 2024, the sector has witnessed more stable volumes, higher margins and reduced volatility, which should help narrow the valuation gap with segments facing high disruption and competition, UBS said.Tata Motors CVUBS said it expects India's commercial vehicles industry to outperform passenger car and two-wheeler segments, in terms of profitability and free cash flow over the next two to three years.Its view is that Tata Motors' commercial vehicles business is now well-placed to deploy its strong free cash flow towards the improving CV cycle, with the demerger freeing meaningful capital for reinvestment and supporting a potential resurgence in market share.The homegrown auto major's demerger came into effect from October 1, 2025, after approval from the National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench, via orders dated August 25 and September 10, 2025.Under the arrangement, the commercial vehicles business undertaking of Tata Motors was demerged into TMLCV, while Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd was amalgamated with Tata Motors Ltd. The appointed date for the scheme was July 1, 2025.Tata Motors Ltd. continues to trade as a listed entity by housing the Commercial Vehicles business, while the PV business trades as a separate listed entity under Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd., which comprises of EVs and the JLR business.The CV entity stock is up around 40% post-listing, but UBS sees further upside.Analyst views and stock performanceHere's a look at the analyst views on Tata Motors Ltd. and Ashok Leyland.CompanyBuyHoldSellTata Motors CV1730Ashok Leyland3393Shares of Tata Motors Ltd. ended the previous session 4.4% lower at ₹444.8 apiece, while Ashok Leyland shares ended 0.1% up at ₹193.25 apiece.Also Read: Nifty F&amp;O Setup: FII net longs increase marginally for the first time in three months",

        "condensed_text": "The order marks a significant milestone for Suzlon, as it is the company’s first engagement with the ArcelorMittal Group and further strengthens its position in India’s renewable energy-driven industrial decarbonisation space. “This project reflects Suzlon’s strategic focus on the EPC segment, where we aim to gradually increase its share to 50% of our overall order book,” Chalasani said, adding that EPC is expected to drive a growing share of future order wins. ArcelorMittal Sustainable Solutions India also reiterated its commitment to securing clean energy for its operations, citing Suzlon’s long-standing track record and reliability in wind energy as key factors behind the partnership. Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services remained positive on Suzlon Energy, citing a favourable risk-reward profile despite near-term concerns around rising competition, slower wind installations and potential cannibalisation from solar-plus-BESS projects. “We estimate that data centres, C&I consumers and PSUs could together drive incremental wind demand of 20–24 GW by 2030, over and above India’s targeted 100 GW wind capacity by FY30,” it said.",

Dhru said the decision was taken now as conditions have stabilised and visibility has improved for the coming quarters.SBFC Finance reported a 34% rise in net profit to ₹118 crore for the October–December 2025 quarter, compared with ₹88 crore in the same period last year.The company’s current market capitalisation stands at ₹9,862.77 crore. So, I want to assure you that I'm as responsible to deliver on all the promises made to investors, and I will be there on the conference calls, accountable and taking responsibility for what we have done.We wanted to do this last year, but last year was a year where there were a lot of wobbliness in the environment, and where the Karnataka ordinance had come in, the numbers had shaken. I thought that this is as good a time as any to do this.Also Read | WeWork India adds 10,000 desks in Q3, plans up to 30,000 new seats in FY27Q: You're saying that you are going to be there very much in a decision-making, overseeing day-to-day, kind of hands-on capacity.A: What I've seen is that while we have done a lot of things right in terms of delivering on the numbers that we had promised, and the company's results are speaking for themselves, one of the softer things is culture in the organisation and how that gets built out. And, while the idea is that, while Mahesh Dayani focuses on delivering the quarter, I help work with him when I go down, travel, meet branches, build the right culture down the branches to ensure that we are able to deliver the decade as well.So, you can continue to hold me responsible for everything that doesn't go right with SBFC, this is not walking away into the sunset.",

Concerns around the US–Iran and Russia–Ukraine conflicts, coupled with supply disruptions following a winter storm that hit US crude output and exports, lifted market sentiment and supported oil prices.

        "condensed_text": "At a time when IndiGo has faced heat over flight disruptions and regulatory scrutiny, the airline has introduced a premium economy-style tier called ‘UpFront’—a clear attempt to monetise comfort and flexibility as Indian flyers become less price-sensitive and more convenience-seeking.UpFront carves out the front rows of the economy cabin for extra legroom and bundled perks like priority meals, higher baggage limits and flexible changes, effectively creating a mini premium tier without a separate cabin.The move comes as Indian airlines see rising demand for differentiated service levels from business and leisure travellers, particularly on longer domestic and regional routes. With travel volumes expanding and a segment of flyers less price-sensitive, carriers have been pushing to lift yields through paid comfort, flexibility and ancillary services rather than depending solely on base fares.For IndiGo, UpFront also signals a gradual evolution from a pure low-cost structure towards a hybrid model—mirroring global trends where volume carriers seek margin improvement by monetising seat comfort, services and time-savings. Since November, IndiGo’s operational calendar has been strained by updated Flight Duty Time Limit  norms that contributed to a pilot shortage and over 3,500 cancellations in early December. A parallel CCI probe added another layer of scrutiny.Geo-political uncertainty has also forced IndiGo to extend cancellations on routes to Tbilisi, Almaty, Baku and Tashkent till February 11 due to tensions in Iran.The turbulence dented investor confidence, shaving nearly 15% off its market value during the time of operational discrepancy in November, even as brokerages like Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and BofA maintained bullish views citing IndiGo’s dominant ~60% domestic share and structurally low-cost operations.Financially, the carrier’s Q3 results reflected the stresses: net profit fell 77.5% YoY to ₹550 crore. Revenue rose 6.2% YoY to ₹23,471 crore, while EBITDA grew 3.6% YoY to ₹5,367 crore with margins at 22.9%.Against this backdrop, the introduction of UpFront looks like part of a broader effort to stabilise yields, restore confidence and capture a segment of premiumising Indian travellers—without abandoning the airline’s affordability thesis.",

The pact aims to enhance operational efficiency, enable faster execution of offshore projects, and create stronger synergies between India's largest oil and gas producer and the nation's biggest and most valuable company who have adjacent fields and operations particularly off the east coast, he said. It seeks to explore opportunities to jointly utilise resources, infrastructure, and technical capabilities across offshore energy activities so as to reduce duplication of efforts, optimise capital deployment, and support timely development of offshore assets, which are critical to meeting India's growing energy demand. ONGC, Reliance and BP in 2024 come together to bid for Block GS-OSHP-2022/2, a 5,454-sq-km offshore tract in the Saurashtra Basin in the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) bid round IX. Giving an example, he said an OSV that ONGC is using on its KG-DWN-98/2 block in the Krishna Godavari basin after finishing work for the company can move to the adjacent KG-DWN-98/3 block of Reliance-BP or vice versa.",

Earnings surprise lifts Axis\nAxis Bank’s stock climbed as high as Rs 1,325.60 on January 27, extending gains amid heavy volumes after the bank reported a standalone net profit of Rs 6,490 crore, up year on year (YoY), supported by a 5 percent rise in net interest income (NII) to Rs 14,287 crore. According to analyst reports from IIFL and Motilal Oswal, despite margin pressures seen across the sector due to higher funding costs, Axis managed to hold its net interest margin (NIM) at 3.64 percent, reassuring investors about its balance-sheet resilience. At current levels, the bank trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 21–22, significantly higher than Axis Bank’s 15-16 times, a premium that some brokerages such as IIFL and Motilal Oswal have questioned amid slower earnings momentum.

Citing the one-time provision of about ₹5.7 crore during the quarter towards the revised labour code guidelines, he said this was offset by a positive impact from tax reversal of ₹21.9 crore. Stating that it sees growth opportunities in the East African dairy market, he said the company is planning a greenfield capacity expansion in Uganda with an estimated investment of ₹50-60 crore.",

Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager, Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said that Shriram Finance is currently in a strong bullish trend, trading above key exponential moving averages, which indicates sustained buying interest.

Jefferies expects total government capital expenditure to grow by about 12% in FY27 to Rs 12.5 lakh crore, but flags that defence capex may grow much faster—by as much as 25%. Motilal Oswal expects defence expenditure to rise by about 15% over the estimated Rs 1.8 lakh crore spending in FY26, even after accounting for a one-time emergency procurement of Rs 40,000 crore undertaken this year. The focus is likely to stay on indigenisation, higher R&D spending and exports, with allocations tilted towards areas such as UAVs, drones, anti-drone systems and other advanced technologies. Crucially, the expected incremental defence budget comes against the backdrop of heightened operational requirements and the need to fast-track key programmes such as QRSAM, naval platforms and missile systems, with a bias towards the Air Force and Navy.",

With meaningful monetary easing from the RBI and fiscal support from the government, the broader macro environment appears supportive for a recovery in growth, which should eventually translate into an earnings revival as well. FMCG is another sector which we believe has potential, as there are some signs of recovery in volume growth, valuations are reasonable relative to history, and ownership is also low. Pharmaceuticals continue to offer a strong growth runway across domestic and export markets, supported by R&D investments, specialty portfolios, and structural growth drivers. Adhering to a disciplined relative-value framework, sector allocation, willingness to rotate capital when better risk-reward opportunities emerge and the ability to reduce exposure when optimism becomes excessive around a certain pocket are all factors which have worked well for the fund thus far.",

        "condensed_text": "Bengaluru-based real estate developer Prestige Group believes India’s real estate market remains on stable ground, provided developers avoid aggressive pricing and speculative behaviour.Irfan Razack, CMD of Prestige Group, said, “I have always said this that if price goes up too fast, too high, then there has to be a little bit of a struggle. We definitely want to make sure that we make two ends meet.”Prices tend to rise when developers become overly optimistic, lock in land at very high costs, and then struggle to sell homes competitively while protecting margins.Keeping these factors in check, Razack believes the market can remain stress-free at current levels, and price stability from here would be healthy for the sector.In the October–December quarter , Prestige Estates reported revenue of ₹38,726 crore and net profit of ₹2,447 crore.He explained that healthy demand is visible when 30–50% of inventory is sold within the first month of a new launch.Prestige Group has already crossed ₹22,000 crore in pre-sales in FY26 and is targeting around ₹30,000 crore by year-end. Razack said maintaining or improving this level in FY27 will depend on how quickly the company can bring new inventory to market across the right geographies and micro-markets.Despite execution pressure, management remains optimistic that FY27 could be better than FY26, backed by a strong project pipeline.Razack does not expect any major announcements for real estate in Budget 2026. Second, he flagged issues around GST on joint development of commercial properties, which he believes leads to unfair double taxation.According to Razack, resolving these issues would help reduce costs and create a fairer operating environment.On the NCR market, often known for speculative cycles, Razack said Prestige has taken a conservative approach. The company’s first project in the region saw strong demand, largely because it focused on genuine homebuyers rather than bulk investors.He added that the group remains cautious while expanding in NCR, keeping a close watch on pricing discipline and buyer quality to avoid volatility.Prestige Estates Projects' current market capitalisation is ₹61,730.10 crore.",

It added that no relaxation has been given to any airline with respect to weekly rest norms.The DGCA clarified that the specific night operations relaxations granted to IndiGo were valid only until February 10.The petitioners, Sabari Roy Lenka, Aman Monga, and Kiran Singh, have alleged that the relaxation from the fatigue regulations was illegally given by the DGCA only to IndiGo and was prima facie malafide.On December 5, 2025, the DGCA rolled out an exemption to FDTL to enable IndiGo to have more pilots on duty to reduce the disruptions and normalise operations.IndiGo cancelled hundreds of flights across the country in the first week of December last year as the airline was not adequately prepared to implement the new flight-duty norms for pilots.",

        "condensed_text": "Without it, there would be no constraints on long-range nuclear arsenals for the first time since Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed two historic agreements in 1972 on the first-ever trip by a US president to Moscow.Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed that the two sides stick to existing missile and warhead limits for one more year to buy time to work out what comes next, but US President Donald Trump has yet to formally respond.Trump said this month that \"if it expires, it expires\", and that the treaty should be replaced with a better one.Some U.S. politicians argue Trump should reject Putin's offer, freeing Washington to grow its arsenal to counter a rapid nuclear build-up by a third power: China.Trump says he wants to pursue \"denuclearisation\" with both Russia and China. But Beijing says it is unreasonable to expect it to join disarmament talks with two countries whose arsenals are still far larger than its own.WHY DO NUCLEAR TREATIES MATTER?Since the darkest Cold War days when the United States and the Soviet Union threatened each other with \"mutually assured destruction\" in the event of nuclear war, both have seen arms limitation treaties as a way to prevent either a lethal misunderstanding or an economically ruinous arms race.The treaties not only set numerical limits on missiles and warheads, but they also require the sides to share information - a critical channel to \"try to understand where the other side is coming from and what their concerns and drivers are\", said Darya Dolzikova at the RUSI think-tank in London.With no new treaty, each would be forced to act according to worst-case assumptions about the weapons the other is producing, testing and deploying, said Nikolai Sokov, a former Soviet and Russian arms negotiator. And of course, if you've got an unregulated arms race, things will get quite destabilising,\" he said.NEW TREATY NO SIMPLE TASKSince the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia and the United States have repeatedly replaced and updated the Cold War-era treaties that limited the so-called strategic weapons they point at each other's cities and bases.The most recent, New START, was signed in 2010 by US President Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally who was then serving as Russian president for four years.It caps the number of deployed strategic warheads at 1,550 on each side, with no more than 700 systems to deliver them from land, sea or air, by intercontinental ballistic missile, submarine-launched missile or heavy bomber.Replacing it with a new treaty would be no simple task. Beijing now has an estimated 600 warheads and the Pentagon estimates it will have more than 1,000 by 2030.Also Read: Indoco Remedies shares gain over 8.5% post USFDA approval for Lacosamide oral solutionA bipartisan Congressional commission in 2023 said the United States was now facing an \"existential challenge\" from not one but two nuclear peers and needed to be prepared for simultaneous wars with Russia and China.Its recommendations included preparing to bring out of storage some or all of the strategic nuclear warheads removed under New START and kept in a reserve stockpile.That could involve restoring warheads removed from Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-fired Trident D5s, and returning to nuclear roles some 30 B-52 strategic bomber planes converted to conventional missions. PUTIN'S OFFER DIVIDES VIEWS IN THE U.S.In policy circles in the United States, views are divided on whether Trump should agree to Putin's offer to keep existing limits in place for a year.Trump should take steps \"to reduce the risk of a wasteful nuclear arms race and to reduce the risk of a catastrophic misinterpretation  that could spiral out of control during a crisis,\" said Paul Dean, a former arms control official now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an advocacy group.Arms control advocates point out that the United States is already facing huge expenses from a nuclear force modernisation programme - including a new submarine, bomber and ICBM – that is suffering serious delays and massive cost overruns.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $1 trillion between 2025 and 2034 to modernise, sustain and operate the nuclear forces.",

He characterised the anticipated quarter four softness as a potential one-off following multiple quarters of strong execution, adding that medium- to long-term growth visibility remains intact.Sectorally, BFSI growth has lagged other segments, but management expects a pickup ahead, supported by improving client performance and stable discretionary spending trends.The company remains confident of maintaining margins within the 24–28% range for FY26, despite a sequential contraction of around 120 basis points.In the October–December quarter , eClerx reported revenue of ₹1,070 crore, net profit of ₹191.8 crore and margins of 25.81%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: In concall you highlighted that the fourth quarter is going to be slightly softer in comparison to the third one. The deal closures the last two quarters, I would say, have been very, very strong and much higher than what we were able to do in quarter one and that trend should broadly continueQ: On margin, they have come off about 120 basis points sequentially, your guidance is 24% to 28% for FY26. That's because the growth figures have been quite high and there's been a slight increase in travel and marketing costs.Q: Do you believe that the margins where they are currently is that a sustainable range or do you see a move in either direction, or is a very broad range, of course, but do you see this as a sustainable range?A: We think it is sustainable. You have announced the bonus already, anything else that you know, one can look at in terms of rewarding shareholders or at the same time making any sort of acquisitions when it comes to Gen AI, because the street was worried about the impact of that on your business?A: We just completed a buyback of about ₹300 crores in the last quarter.",

Dixon pared its FY26 mobile volume guidance to 34-35 mn (from earlier 40-42mn) and withdrew its FY27 guidance (from 55-65 mn earlier) mainly due to uncertainty from memory price increases impacting end demand as well as delays in Vivo JV approval\nJp Morgan believes withdrawing the guidance is right thing to do in times of uncertainty and provides optionality if & when Vivo JV approval comes through.

        "condensed_text": "Shares of Paytm parent, One97 Communications Ltd , slipped 4 per cent on Friday even after the company swung to profit in the December quarter, as investors weighed largely in-line results and near-term concerns around incentives from the RBI’s Payments Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) scheme. The stock declined as much as 4 per cent and was trading about 3 per cent lower at ₹1,132.50 around 12.10 pm, after touching an intraday low of ₹1,115.60 against the previous close of ₹1,168.10. Consolidated revenue from operations rose 20 per cent y-o-y to ₹2,914 crore during the quarter under review from ₹1,828 crore in the year-ago period, driven by growth in financial services and steady expansion in its payments franchise. The brokerage lowered longer-term estimates to reflect the absence of PIDF incentives, which had provided a meaningful boost to profitability, but added that monetisation of payments should continue to improve structurally and that the higher-margin financial services business retains strong growth momentum in merchant lending and equity broking. On the other hand, CLSA retained an underperform rating at ₹1,000, and flagged a sharp quarter-on-quarter rise in employee operating costs and cut its profit-before-tax estimates after factoring in the cessation of PIDF income.",

We often see one step ahead and two steps behind,” Sardana said.He pointed to Uttar Pradesh as an example, where privatisation of discoms was earlier proposed but has since been put on hold. “Privatisation of UP discoms was on the cards, but it has been put off now. That’s bad news,” he said.Sardana said sustained reform in distribution is critical for the long-term health of the power sector, even as discom finances have improved in recent years. He added that industry participants would be closely watching whether the upcoming Budget delivers a clear signal on whether discom privatisation will finally gather pace.",

Despite the flush season, do you think the guidance you gave of 8–10% could face some downside risk?A: Regarding our procurement prices, it was unusual that the flush season, which normally is a period of surplus for the dairy industry, this year was lacking, and the surplus was not available in the system, as most of the country was running through a shortage. That is why procurement prices did not come down and became as expensive as normal summer prices.Also Read: Dodla Dairy trims FY26 revenue target, expects 10-12% growthHowever, we have already factored in summer prices, and we have not yet taken a price hike in the current period. So, our revenue guidance would now be in the range of 14–15%, which is what we are looking at.As far as EBITDA margins are concerned, although currently they are showing around 7.5%, we still believe they can move back into the 8–9% EBITDA margin range.Q: When are you planning to take a price hike? We expect revenues of around ₹150–160 crore in the current financial year, with EBITDA margins of about 10%.Capacity utilisation is currently around 50–55%, and over the next one to one-and-a-half years, we expect this to rise to 80–90%, which could take revenues to around ₹400 crore in the medium term.Q: Finally, on expansion plans — particularly in Maharashtra — where does the capex stand, and what are the timelines for Orgafeed?A: For Orgafeed, existing capacity utilisation is around 50–55%, and we expect it to reach full utilisation over the next one to one-and-a-half years.Also Read: India Inc to Budget 2026: Stay the reform course, boost competitiveness, keep capex strongAs far as Maharashtra is concerned, out of the ₹280 crore capex earmarked, we have already spent ₹60 crore.",

The government proposed to raise the STT by more than 50% on futures to 0.05% from 0.02% and to 0.15% from 0.01% on options, raising concerns of a reduction in volumes. Decoding the impact of STT on the derivatives segment, Shripal Shah, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities, said that the steep increase in STT on futures and options, coming on top of last year’s hike, is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers, and arbitrageurs. Decoding the impact of such STT hike on FPI acticity, Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking, said it is likely to act as a marginal negative for foreign portfolio investor flows in the near term, particularly for high-frequency and derivative-focused global funds. Recent data already shows that FPIs have been cautious — with equity outflows of over ₹ 41,000 crore in January 2026 alone, reflecting global risk-off sentiment, elevated US bond yields, and currency pressures.",

        "condensed_text": "STT tax hike: Following the announcement of a hike in securities transaction tax (STT) on the equity derivatives segment of the Indian stock market, capital market stocks witnessed a sharp slide of up to 14% in intraday deals on Sunday, February 1. The government proposed to raise the STT by more than 50% on futures to 0.05% from 0.02% and to 0.15% from 0.01% on options, raising concerns of a reduction in volumes. Decoding the impact of STT on the derivatives segment, Shripal Shah, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities, said that the steep increase in STT on futures and options, coming on top of last year’s hike, is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers, and arbitrageurs. Decoding the impact of such STT hike on FPI acticity, Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking, said it is likely to act as a marginal negative for foreign portfolio investor flows in the near term, particularly for high-frequency and derivative-focused global funds. Recent data already shows that FPIs have been cautious — with equity outflows of over ₹ 41,000 crore in January 2026 alone, reflecting global risk-off sentiment, elevated US bond yields, and currency pressures.",

However, the government allocated ₹ 7.85 lakh crore to the defence sector in the Union Budget 2026, marking a 15% increase over the ₹ 6.81 lakh crore provided in FY26. Ahead of the Budget, several brokerages had projected up to a 30% rise in the defence allocation, expecting a greater share to be directed toward domestic procurement, modernisation programmes, and research and development. Shares across defence counters witnessed sharp declines, with Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers plunging 14% to ₹ 2,382.00, Data Patterns (India) dropping 13.5% to ₹ 2,310.60, and Paras Defence and Space Technologies falling over 12% to an intraday low of ₹ 625.05.

Gold and silver prices extended their steep fall on Sunday, February 1, hitting the 9% lower circuit as investors rushed to book profits amid a global selloff triggered by a stronger US dollar. On MCX, silver prices dropped 9% to the lower circuit at ₹ 2,65,652 per kg, while MCX gold prices also hit their 9% lower circuit at ₹ 1,36,185 per 10 grams. Although Warsh’s stance had appeared to soften in recent months, aligning with calls for lower interest rates, analysts believe he may revert to a stricter policy approach if inflationary pressures return.",

Calling it a strategic move to secure India’s critical mineral supply chain and reduce reliance on China, particularly for rare earth magnets used in electronics, EVs, and defence applications, SAMCO Securities' Divyam Mour said focus on integrated exploration, mining, refining, and downstream manufacturing would enhance domestic value addition and supports India’s high-tech manufacturing ambitions. Additionally, NLC India Limited’s collaboration with IREL (India) Limited strengthens execution capability in rare earth mining and processing, positioning these firms as long-term beneficiaries of this policy thrust,\" SAMCO's research analyst said. Citing a scheme introduced in 2025 for rare earth permanent magnets, the FM Nirmala Sitharama said the government has proposed to support the mineral-rich states of Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to establish dedicated rare earth corridors and expand its rare earth scheme to promote mining, processing, research and manufacturing. SAMCO Mour said the increased Rs 40,000 crore outlay for electronics manufacturing, coupled with industry-led research and training centres, significantly strengthens India’s ambition to build a self-reliant chip ecosystem while reducing structural dependence on China for critical semiconductor supplies.",

        "condensed_text": "Shares of listed broking firms such as BSE Ltd, Angel One , Groww, Nuvama and IIFL Capital Services came under sharp selling pressure after the increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options, sparking concerns over trading volumes and near-term profitability for capital market intermediaries. Jateen Trivedi, VP – Research Analyst (Commodity and Currency) at LKP Securities, said markets were already uneasy about the fiscal deficit target of 4.3 per cent for FY27, but the sharper reaction stemmed from the higher transaction levies. He added that investors should remain focused on sectors with strong earnings visibility rather than capital-intensive plays, and argued that the government’s long-term vision for market stability and maturity could ultimately benefit the broader financial ecosystem through FY27. Echoing concerns around trading activity, Shripal Shah, Managing Director and CEO of Kotak Securities, said the steep increase in STT on futures and options, coming on top of last year’s hike, is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers and arbitrageurs. Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking, warned that the STT increase could act as a marginal negative for foreign portfolio investor flows in the near term, particularly for high-frequency and derivative-focused global funds.",

He's repeatedly said Iran wants to negotiate and has brought up Tehran's nuclear programme as another issue he wants to see resolved.But Iran had planned a live-fire military drill for Sunday and Monday in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil traded passes. The US military's Central Command had warned against threatening American warships or aircraft during the drill or disrupting commercial traffic.Read more: Elon Musk to Donald Trump, who's who of powerful men named in Epstein filesIranian state television reported Khamenei's comments online before airing any footage of his remarks.“The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying.Khamenei further said: “We are not the instigators and we do not seek to attack any country.

In the Budget, Nirmala Sitharaman doubled down on the government’s infrastructure-led growth strategy in the Union Budget 2026, proposing a sharp increase in capital expenditure to Rs 12.2 lakh crore for FY2026–27, up from Rs 11.2 lakh crore in the current fiscal. The Budget underscored the scale of India’s public investment cycle over the past decade, with capital expenditure rising more than fivefold from Rs 2 lakh crore in 2014–15 to Rs 11.2 lakh crore in the FY2025–26 Budget Estimates. Sitharaman reiterated that infrastructure creation would remain a priority, particularly in cities with populations above five lakh, including fast-growing tier-2 and tier-3 urban centres.",

        "condensed_text": "Union Budget 2026:In a move aimed at simplifying tax compliance for retail investors, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2026 speech proposed enabling depositories to accept Form 15G and Form 15H from taxpayers holding securities across multiple companies and share the declarations directly with the relevant entities. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Budget 2026 speech said, “For the ease of taxpayers holding securities in multiple companies, I propose to enable depositories to accept Form 15G or Form 15H from the investor and provide it directly to various relevant companies.”\nForm 15G and Form 15H are self-declaration forms that allow eligible taxpayers to seek exemption from tax deducted at source (TDS) on income such as dividends and interest, provided their overall income remains below the taxable threshold. Lt Col Rochak Bakshi, CFP and Managing Director, Trunor Enterprises, said centralising the submission of Form 15G and Form 15H could ease compliance significantly for small taxpayers and senior citizens. The proposal also assumes significance in the post-dividend distribution tax regime, where dividend income is fully taxable in the hands of investors, making timely and accurate submission of self-declaration forms critical to avoid excess tax deduction. “Centralised acceptance simplifies compliance for investors holding shares across multiple companies, reduces paperwork, and lowers the chances of errors in TDS deductions,” he said.",

TCS stock closed 1.92% higher at Rs 3185.15 and Infosys shares ended 1.17% higher at Rs 1659.65 after FM Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to provide a safe harbour of 15.5% to the resident entity providing data centre services to a related foreign company (who is providing cloud services to any part of the world outside India). Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in India have been moving away increasing from a cost effectiveness play to a more strategic role; the proposed uniform safe harbour margin of 15.5% across a spectrum of IT services, with the threshold increased from Rs 300 crore to Rs 2,000 crore, is likely to further incentivise the shifting of higher value-added tech functions to GCCs in India, as they may likely be within the safe harbour range. While creating an integrated IT/ITeS bucket helps resolve pain points in clearly categorising various GCC activities within the current safe harbour categories, there may still be certain high value strategic and ESG activities which fall outside the IT/ITeS category, the treatment for which remains to be seen. Shares of Allied Digital Services (14.97%), Onward Technologies (7.16%), Orient Technologies (6.38%) and Infobeans Technologies (6%), Aurionpro Solutions (5.57%) and Netweb Technologies (5.10%)  were the top gainers on the BSE IT Index.",

        "condensed_text": "While Union Budget 2026-27 reinforced the government’s commitment to infrastructure-led growth, the real estate sector said the absence of policy support for affordable housing was a big disappointment, warning that the segment, already under stress since the pandemic, could shrink further. ANAROCK Group chairman Anuj Puri said the budget delivered limited direct relief to real estate, offering instead indirect benefits through higher capital expenditure, manufacturing, MSMEs, tourism, high-speed rail corridors and green transition initiatives. Echoing similar concerns, CREDAI national president Shekhar Patel said developers welcome the continued emphasis on infrastructure spending but was “deeply disappointed” by the lack of concrete measures for affordable housing. “With the current outdated definition of affordable housing, CREDAI estimates that the segment’s share could decline further from 18 percent to nearly 12 percent of total housing supply,” Patel said, calling it a “serious warning sign” for India’s lower middle class and middle-class homebuyers. While the Budget’s focus on REIT-led monetisation of CPSE commercial assets, data centres, temple towns and Tier-2 and Tier-3 city growth is expected to boost commercial real estate and urban expansion, developers said affordable housing remains the missing piece in the government’s housing and urban growth strategy.",

Furthermore, Shah commended the budget's commitment to inclusion, pointing to the focus on inclusion, including SMEs, MSMEs, small and marginal farmers, youth, capacity building, and women, as integral components for driving overall economic growth. He explained that as the budget enhances India's competitiveness in manufacturing, it enables the group to further its 'make in India for the world' strategy and also attracts more foreign companies to the country. Shah concluded by noting that multiple sectors in which the Mahindra Group operates, particularly its hospitality and logistics businesses, are very well-placed to benefit from the new policies.",

The index would need to close above the 25,200 zone for the bias to improve and thereafter, establish conviction for further rise.”\nOn the outlook of the Bank Nifty today, Parekh said, “The Bank Nifty index plunged heavily with a huge red candle on the daily chart, hitting the low near the 57,800 zone during the intraday session, with bias weakening and breaching the important support levels as of now, with further slide anticipated in the coming sessions. As mentioned earlier, the index would have the important and crucial support positioned near the significant 200-period MA at 56,800-zone, which needs to be sustained, failing which the overall trend would turn bearish.”\nParekh stated that immediate support for the Nifty 50 index is located at 24,600, while the resistance level is at 25,000. 1] TCS: Buy at ₹ 3186, Target ₹ 3310, Stop Loss ₹ 3120;\n2] Delhivery: Buy at ₹ 436.80, Target ₹ 460, Stop Loss ₹ 426; and\n3] RateGain: Buy at ₹ 629.45, Target ₹ 665, Stop Loss ₹ 615.",

What to expect from Hyundai Q3 results Analysts expect revenues to increase by 8% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis led by 5% YoY increase in volumes and 2-3% YoY increase in ASPs, led by a richer product mix (higher mix of SUV and diesel powertrain) and richer geographical mix. Kotak Equities expects EBITDA margin to increase by 150 bps YoY basis to 12.8% in 3QFY26, mainly due to a richer product mix and cost-control measures, partly offset by higher cost pertaining to the new plant. On a QoQ basis, it sees EBITDA margin to decline by 110 bps due to new plant-related costs, higher commodity costs and an inferior product mix, partly offset by higher government incentives and lower discounts. NIM compression will likely be moderate at 8 bps QoQ to 3.4% due to sharp decline in yields, partially offset by decline in cost of borrowings, analysts said.",

While the RSI is still below the overbought threshold of 70, it is moving closer to that zone, suggesting that buying interest remains firm but the scope for sharp upside may be limited in the short term as momentum begins to moderate.

        "condensed_text": "Over Friday and Sunday, five stocks in the index erased close to ₹2 lakh crore in market capitalisation, led by Hindustan Zinc and its parent Vedanta.Hindustan Copper opened around 4% higher on Monday after emerging as the biggest laggard in the previous session, when the stock plunged 19%. Copper fell further on Monday, adding to the steep correction seen at the end of last week, as traders brace for heightened volatility following a turbulent start to the year.On the London Metal Exchange, copper declined as much as 3.3% to $12,722 a tonne. The metal had surged to a record above $14,500 last Thursday before tumbling below $13,000 in intraday trade on Friday.Base and precious metals have been rattled over the past week by intense speculative activity, particularly in China, driven by concerns around the US dollar’s outlook.Adding to the turmoil, Chinese metals traders have reportedly suffered losses of at least 1 billion yuan, or about $144 million, after a counterparty fled the country leaving trades unsettled. The situation has raised alarms among regulators over hidden financial risks.The crisis is linked to a trading network run by metals dealer Xu Maohua, known as “The Hat”, with state-backed SDIC Commodities Co. among the prominent entities involved, according to people familiar with the matter.Xu allegedly owed money for copper and other metal shipments, triggering a chain of unpaid dues and at least one lawsuit seeking over 200 million yuan in damages.Across commodities, spot silver is now trading flat after plunging as much as 6% in early trade, briefly rebounding before giving up gains. Gold was trading around 3% lower in early spot market action.The broader sell-off has been exacerbated by a stronger US dollar, which posted its biggest rally since May after US President Donald Trump named Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve Chair.The dollar index has climbed back above 97 after sliding to its lowest levels since February 2022 earlier last week.",

        "condensed_text": "KPIT Technologies Ltd is seeing a gradual improvement in demand visibility as global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) recalibrate spending priorities after a prolonged slowdown, according to the company's top management. In an interaction with Business Today , Sachin Tikekar, Joint MD and Co-founder at KPIT Tech, said the passenger car segment has been under pressure for nearly a year and a half, with OEMs cutting R&D and overall spending by 20–25 per cent during 2025. He highlighted that OEM investments are increasingly focused on high-impact areas such as digital cockpit and in-cabin experiences, Level-3 ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) scaling, cybersecurity for connected vehicles and after-sales diagnostics. On the commercial vehicle side, Tikekar stated that the global truck sales saw a cyclical downturn in 2025, but the company expects a recovery in the second half of 2026. Off-highway vehicles have emerged as the most resilient sub-segment, with spending holding up in 2025 and expected to rise modestly in 2026.",

Different stages, different skills\nAccording to Mittal, most founders excel in the early phases — taking an idea from zero to one, and then from one to ten. The founder retains ownership and long-term upside, while the company benefits from seasoned management—often leading to better outcomes for shareholders. In India, however, such transitions are frequently portrayed as the founder being “fired,” failing, or involved in wrongdoing. Often, stepping down as CEO is not about loss of control — but about choosing what is best for the company’s long-term growth.",

        "condensed_text": "Shares of Billionbrains Garage Ventures , Groww's parent company, fell sharply on Monday after the Union Budget 2026 announced a hike in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options (F&O) trades. As per the Budget announcement, STT on futures has been raised to 0.05% from 0.02%, while STT on options has been increased to 0.15% from 0.10%, making derivatives trading more expensive for market participants. Commenting on the impact of the STT hike, Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, said that the move could be equity-positive in the long run, as higher costs may discourage excessive speculative option trading. From a valuation perspective, Billionbrains Garage Ventures is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 60.16 and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 22.52, indicating relatively rich valuations. In its latest financial performance, the company reported strong December 2025 quarterly results, with revenue of Rs 861 crore and a net profit of Rs 428 crore, reflecting robust growth despite recent market volatility .",

Net profit stood at ₹ 1.88 crore, marking a 13.36% decline both YoY and QoQ compared to ₹ 2.17 crore reported in the December 2024 quarter as well as the September 2025 quarter. Despite the sharp rise in revenue, the small-cap company, with a market capitalisation of ₹ 998.00 crore, witnessed margin pressure, raising concerns over the sustainability of its recent topline-driven growth. MIC Electronics recently secured a major domestic contract valued at approximately ₹ 114.10 crore from the Nava Raipur Atal Nagar Vikas Pradhikaran for infrastructure development at a common facility centre in Chhattisgarh. This win follows another order under the Amrit Bharat Scheme, where the company secured a contract from the Central Railway’s Nagpur Division to upgrade telecom assets and passenger facilities across seven stations.",

        "condensed_text": "Morgan Stanley said the early mention of “semiconductors” in the Budget speech signals a clear shift in the government’s priorities, highlighting India’s push into AI, advanced manufacturing, and strategic sectors. Tax clarity for IT services, a 20-year tax break for data centers, and incentives for energy, semiconductors, electronics, and critical minerals underscore the government’s focus on strengthening India’s position in emerging technologies, with progress on large language models expected soon. Priorities include defense, high-speed rail, waterways, select dedicated freight corridors, and urbanization, alongside targeted incentives for sectors such as chemicals, capital goods, biopharma, textiles, and sports goods. Morgan Stanley said reforms to boost capital market flows, including raising limits for non-residents from 10 per cent to 24 per cent and lowering buyback taxes from dividend to capital gains rates, could increase demand for equities. While corporate India paid around Rs 5 lakh crore in dividends over the trailing 12 months, buybacks fell from Rs 50,000 crore in FY24 to Rs 19,000 crore, a gap that could now be filled.",

        "condensed_text": "Nomura on Monday described Budget 2026 as mixed, noting that while it included measures to boost manufacturing, exports, capital expenditure, defense, and resilience in critical minerals, the pace of fiscal consolidation was slower than expected. Nomura said: “The budget assumptions of capex and revex are largely realistic, although we assume slightly lower targets owing to consolidation later in the year if revenues disappoint. Thus, we believe the fiscal deficit target of 4.3 per cent of GDP for FY27 is achievable.”\nOverall, Nomura found the budget assumptions credible and estimated a fiscal impulse of 0.6 percentage points in FY27, implying a modest positive boost to growth. On the policy front, Nomura highlighted initiatives including a manufacturing push for electronics components, containers, textiles, and sports goods; the establishment of a rare earth corridor; a 17 per cent increase in defense capex; and tax holidays for foreign cloud service providers using Indian data centers. Indirect tax changes mainly focused on customs duty cuts for labour-intensive industries (marine, leather, textiles), nuclear power, aircraft manufacturing, clean energy, critical minerals, and personal imports.",

It is a huge engineering marvel that operates under Western Railway, Central Railway, and the Metro without interfering with the current infrastructure.After descending from Orange Gate and bending at P D'Mello Road, the tunnel would travel east-west beneath railway tracks, the JJ Flyover, Bhendi Bazaar, Khetwadi, Lamington Road and the Old Elphinstone bridge at Chinch Bunder. Following that, it will bend once again and exit close to Jawahar Bal Bhavan, near the Charni Road station on Marine Drive.Additionally, the tunnel will improve access to locations such as Navi Mumbai and the airport by reinforcing connections with other major roads, including the Coastal Road, Eastern Freeway, and Mumbai Trans Harbour Link.Construction progress and timelineThe MMRDA-led project construction contract has been granted to Larsen &amp; Toubro .",

Lupin Ltd. on Monday, February 2, announced two key developments spanning its innovation and generics businesses, including a tuberculosis-focused drug collaboration and the launch of an oncology generic in the US, underscoring the drugmaker’s push across specialty and complex generic therapies.In a regulatory filing, Lupin said it has entered a strategic collaboration with TB Alliance to advance the clinical development and commercialisation of Telacebec, an investigational drug for the treatment of tuberculosis  and other mycobacterial diseases, including leprosy and Buruli ulcer.Under the agreement, TB Alliance will continue to lead the clinical development of Telacebec, while Lupin will support the programme through its global manufacturing, regulatory and supply chain capabilities to enable wider patient access once approved.Telacebec, formerly known as Q203, is being developed as a novel therapy for TB and related infections that continue to affect millions of people globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.Ramesh Swaminathan, Executive Director, Global CFO and Head of IT and API Plus SBU at Lupin, said, “By leveraging our manufacturing scale and globaldistribution capabilities alongside TB Alliance’s deep expertise in drug development, we aim to enable timely and equitable access to Telacebec and contribute meaningfully to the global fight against tuberculosis, leprosy, and Buruli ulcer.”Mel Spigelman, President and CEO of TB Alliance, said Telacebec has the potential to transform treatment for long-neglected mycobacterial diseases. Partnering with Lupin, he noted, would help move the compound forward more efficiently while ensuring responsible development and access across geographies.Separately, Lupin also announced the launch of Dasatinib Tablets in the United States after receiving approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for its Abbreviated New Drug Application .The product was developed in partnership with Pharmascience Inc. and is a generic version of Sprycel, an oncology drug used in the treatment of multiple forms of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia  and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  in both adult and paediatric patients.According to the company, Dasatinib tablets had estimated annual sales of about $930 million in the US for the 12 months ended October 2025, highlighting the commercial significance of the launch in Lupin’s US generics portfolio.In December, Swaminathan had unveiled the pharma major's plans to grow its specialty medicines business as part of its long-term strategy beyond generics. The shift he said is natural for Indian pharma and is “basically a question of evolution.”Despite the two announcements, shares of Lupin were trading near the intraday lows. As of 11.20 am, the stock was trading 2.51% down at ₹2,081.70.",

The allocation stands at about ₹2.31 lakh crore, with nearly 75% earmarked for domestic procurement.Within defence, Kapadia sees growth momentum in segments such as other equipment, construction-related work, and high-mobility vehicles.On stock picks, his preferred public sector names are BEML, Hindustan Aeronautics, and Bharat Dynamics. He pointed out that only two segments—coach procurement and locomotives—have seen an increase in physical volumes.In contrast, segments such as doubling of railway lines and new line construction have seen a decline in kilometres added. However, the value of these projects has risen, largely due to higher input and commodity costs rather than higher execution volumes.Kapadia explained that coach procurement volumes are expected to rise by around 10%, while locomotive volumes could increase by about 7%. His key picks include BEML and Siemens for locomotives and related systems.In electrical equipment and components, CG Power, ABB India and HPL Electric &amp; Power, stand to benefit from higher electrification and cabling-related orders.For full interview, watch accompanying videoFollow our live blog for more stock market updates",

Shares of Bharat Dynamics declined 6% on Monday, February 2, extending weakness across defence stocks, with 16 of the 18 constituents of the Nifty Defence index trading in the red.The decline comes as brokerages point to the lack of major policy announcements for the sector in the Union Budget, even though the government raised defence capital expenditure.Analysts said the absence of any \"big bang\" reforms weighed on near-term sentiment, triggering profit-taking across defence names.That said, brokerages remain constructive on the medium-term outlook, citing that higher capital spending should continue to support order inflows.The Union Budget has raised core defence capital expenditure by 18% year-on-year for FY27, while the total defence outlay now stands at ₹7.6 lakh crore, up 7% from the revised estimate.Nomura said the Budget fell short of transformative measures but added that the increase in capital allocation is a positive for the sector.Goldman Sachs said in its note that FY27 defence spending has come in ahead of its estimates. The brokerage pointed to a sharp rise in allocations within capital procurement, with spending on 'Other Equipment', which includes missiles, ammunition and radar electronics, up 62% to ₹82,200 crore.It added that Bharat Dynamics is well positioned to benefit from this spending focus.Bharat Dynamics is also among the top picks of Harshit Kapadia of Elara Securities.The stock's decline follows weak quarterly earnings.Bharat Dynamics reported its Q3 results on January 31, with net profit falling 50.3% year-on-year to ₹73 crore. Revenue declined 32% to ₹566.6 crore.The company's EBITDA dropped sharply by 79.5% to ₹26 crore, while EBITDA margin narrowed to 4.6% from 15.3% a year ago.",

        "condensed_text": "“The 10-year bond yields have now gone up to 6.76%,” he said, adding that with such discipline, yields should be closer to 6%.According to Mishra, this is happening because the government has made very conservative assumptions on growth and revenues, and more importantly, on inflows from small savings schemes.He stated that collections under small savings have risen sharply during the current year, but the Budget assumes much lower inflows ahead. “This means that you’re expecting ₹1 lakh crore, ₹1.2 lakh crore less… than what you’re likely to get,” Mishra said.Also Read | Budget 2026: Higher borrowing worries bonds, but corporate credit set to rise, says SBI's CS SettyBecause of this underestimation, the government has announced a higher gross borrowing programme than what may actually be needed. “The headline thought is that it was completely predictable, and I think that’s a good thing,” he said, explaining that stability and lack of surprises help businesses and investors plan better.He also praised the government for avoiding wasteful spending and for staying focused on fiscal consolidation, which should normally help keep borrowing costs low.However, he flagged another important factor adding to the pressure on yields — the government’s large cash balances. “It’ll take much longer to close that ga,p and therefore there is definitely an impact,” he cautioned, adding that this may already be visible in the recent weakness seen in banking stocks.Also Read | Union Budget 2026 signals stability and long-term growth for India, say global expertsOn the Budget’s proposals related to data centres, Mishra said these measures should be seen mainly as an enabling step. He explained that the tax changes are meant to allow global companies operating in India to serve other regions as well, without facing adverse tax treatment because of data localisation rules.However, he said large investments in data centres will ultimately depend far more on practical factors such as the cost of power, land and water, rather than on tax incentives alone.For the entire interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

        "condensed_text": "Motherson Sumi Wiring India remains confident about its growth outlook, supported by strong demand from the domestic automotive industry and rising content per vehicle.Despite near-term margin pressure from elevated copper prices and currency volatility, the company expects these headwinds to normalise, aided by pass-through mechanisms embedded in customer contracts.Anurag Gahlot, COO of Motherson Sumi Wiring India, said the recent margin softness is temporary and does not impact the company’s medium-term profitability outlook.Looking ahead, the company’s focus continues to be on maintaining high capital efficiency, with return on capital employed  expected to stay above 40%. Expansion plans remain closely aligned with confirmed customer orders, ensuring disciplined capacity addition.Most existing plants are already operating at high utilisation levels, while new Greenfield facilities are ramping up steadily, positioning the company to meet future demand without stretching its balance sheet.The long-term growth story is also being supported by structural trends such as the rising share of feature-rich SUVs and increasing complexity of wiring harnesses across powertrains. Copper is one of the commodity in our cases, and but we have the back to back arrangement, the pass through arrangement with the customer, with a lag of a quarter in the major customer and on six months for the rest of the customer.This is not something which is very much worried to us at this moment, because we have these customer contract in place where we have passed through arrangement with them on the commodity as well as on the Forex fluctuation.Q: How much lower can margins go before they start stabilising. But as a company, we believe in doing the ROCE, or Return on Capital Employed, our target is more than 40% and happy to tell you, in last three years, we are doing more than 40%.This year, in our last nine months, we are on track and by the quarter four end also, you will see positive - more than 40% subject to what customer is going to manufacture, what they forecasted to us.Q: We also understand that the revenues did not account for the kind of copper prices rise that we have seen in the third quarter. The plant in Gujarat, Mandal, there are two power train projects, which are under launch at this moment, and they will be also ramping up the volume by quarter four and quarter one and the third plant in Pune, which is around at this moment is coming to around 50% utilisation.Other than Greenfield, most of our balanced plants are reaching to the 80% utilisation because the there is a surge of the demand from the customer.",

Premium products will see 10% growth compared to the previous guidance of 20% in FY26, Aggarwal added.Q3 earningsInsecticides' third quarter earnings were largely in-line, while its net profit was slightly below estimates.It reported a net profit of 10 crore, down 40% from the previous year's 17 crore.Its gross profit declined 3%, while its gross profit margin was down 370 basis points to 32.4% from 36.1% in the year-ago period.

If they are not scared, I should be allowed to read on,\" Rahul Gandhi said.Speaker Om Birla ruled against Gandhi quoting from the unpublished story or even the magazine story that Gandhi reasoned he was citing the issue from.Home Minister Amit Shah also objected to Gandhi's address and alleged that the Congress leader was violating the rules of the House by continuing to speak on the issue even after Speaker asked him not to.Similar sentiments were shared by Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kiren Rijiju. \"We should also discuss what should be done with a member who doesn't obey the Speaker's ruling in Lok Sabha,\" he said.Congress leader KC Venugopal and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav showed support for Gandhi stating that if something concerning China is there in his address, he should be able to tell the House. \"China is a sensitive issue, if there is some suggestion in country's interest, the LoP should be allowed to read it,\" Yadav said.The government reasoned that the session was not scheduled to address any such issues and was a Motion of Thanks after President Droupadi Murmu's address.",

        "condensed_text": "Rising memory chip prices have emerged as the biggest near-term risk for the smartphone industry and for Dixon Technologies, with the cost shock already hurting demand in the market, said Saurabh Gupta, Director-Finance &amp; Group CFO of Dixon Technologies.Gupta said memory prices have almost doubled over the last year, driven by limited global manufacturing capacity and a growing share of chips being diverted to higher-margin, artificial intelligence -led applications.He explained that the impact is most severe on the low-end and mid-range smartphone segments, where memory typically forms 12–15% of the total cost of the device. The pressure is already visible in the market, which recorded a 7%degrowth in the October-December quarter of 2025 , making memory prices one of the most critical variables to track over the coming months.Against this immediate cost challenge, Gupta also flagged the uncertainty around the mobile production-linked incentive  scheme. While this lack of clarity remains an overhang for the sector, he stressed that policy engagement with the industry continues.Also Read: Budget 2026 silent on Mobile PLI 2.0 as incentives taper, policy focus shifts to electronics components“We feel that the government wants to provide support to the sector till the time the corporate ecosystem gets created,” Gupta said, pointing to a clear policy shift towards component manufacturing and localisation. “We have been investing in backward integration, so we are investing in the camera modules… the display panels, display modules,” Gupta said.He added that several of these projects are expected to go live and that meaningful margin improvement from these investments is likely to come through in 2026-27  and 2027-28 .

        "condensed_text": "Gangadi Madhukar Reddy, MD and CEO at MedPlus Health Services, sees the company entering a phase of steadier and more sustainable growth, supported by improving execution on the ground.After a period of rapid expansion that stretched backend capabilities, MedPlusis now benefiting from easing supply-side constraints, better warehouse coverage, and smoother movement of inventory across stores. The company has moderated its aggressive push on private-label medicines and is prioritising branded products and general merchandise, which helps protect headline growth and improves customer wallet share without creating friction.Management believes this balanced product mix, combined with improving logistics, provides greater visibility on revenue growth while keeping margins resilient.In October–December quarter , MedPlus Health reported revenue of ₹1,806 crore, profit of ₹57.8 crore and margins at 8.80%.These are the edited excerpts of the interview.Q: What stood out was your same store sales growth in your stores which have 12 months plus on them, it was double digits for the first time since quarter four of FY24, it was around 10% plus. It's still works in progress, but it will get better as we go forward.The second thing, our own decision to I wouldn't say, step back, but take the foot off the pedal on the private label - medicine side meant that the growth came in with the full numbers. So, both those reasons, slightly better logistics management, and also a decision to push forward on the brands and not necessarily continually push the private label - probably led to this.Q: You have spoken about store expansion; will you use your entire cash for that or will you reward shareholders with that? Here, there is absolutely no limit to what you can grow on the non-pharma side.Q: Are you on track to hit that 600 store guidance for FY26 because you have done around 400 for nine months?A: Given that we did 182 stores this quarter, we will probably increase it a little bit and then get to that 600, I don't see any problem with that.Q: How you doing on your diagnostic business front?",

        "condensed_text": "Pavitra Shankar, Managing Director of Brigade Enterprises, said the company will continue to focus on key South India markets for growth.She said, “We are present in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.” She added that the company is not currently looking at expansion into the NCR market and will continue to focus on its existing regions.She said, “So far, we have been focusing on South Indian markets.” She said these markets have supported business development and project launches over the past few years.Brigade Enterprises reported a 21% year-on-year  decline in net profit for the October-December 2025 quarter at ₹186.5 crore, compared with ₹236.2 crore in the same period last year. So, we're seeing a stabilisation of that demand across all our markets, Bengaluru, Chennai, and to an extent, Hyderabad, which is still able to absorb very high-ticket sizes.Q: Does that mean this 15 to 20% sort of bookings growth guidance that you had given for the full financial year stays? It is just about timing and getting the approvals on time, and being able to get those numbers related to that.Q: So, you're sticking to the 15 to 20% kind of a target, despite the nine-month decline that we've seen where bookings are down 15%, or do you think you may need to revise that guidance?A: The numbers that we hope to do every year are heavily dependent on launches. So, the guidance, so to speak, will depend on that.Q: What's the launch that you've earmarked for the fourth quarter?A: We are hoping to do about 4-5 million square feet in the next couple of quarters, and ideally the bulk of that will come in quarter four barring that, we will have a bit of a challenge in terms of doing sales from new projects, but existing projects are all selling well, and we're still seeing good traction in terms of those.Q: You don't have multi-geography exposure for Brigade, so to speak, to protect yourself from a downturn, especially in what we've been seeing in the NCR region. We are hoping to get our current portfolio to about ₹1,500 crore in terms of leasing revenue, and we're hoping to grow that to maybe another ₹2,000 crore in the coming years ahead.Q: That is when you plan the REIT or separation of that business, or value unlocking out there?A: We'll definitely be examining that based on the top line.Q: So that happens in the next couple of years?A: These projects have to get built out, leased up, and then we will take a call accordingly.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

Over the medium term, he said operating efficiency should improve as the drag from the microfinance portfolio fades.In the October–December quarter of 2025 , IDFC First Bank reported a 12% year-on-year rise in net interest income to ₹5,492 crore, compared with ₹4,902 crore a year ago. The bank’s market capitalisation stands at around ₹69,478.37 crore, and its shares have gained close to 30% over the past one year.Below are the edited excerpts from the interview.Q: Sharp margin improvement on the back of that steep fall in cost of funds by 12 basis points. Could you do even better than that?A: 5.8 is definitely locked in, because it can only get better over what this quarter was, because we just recently cut savings rates, and in some buckets, we cut into 200 basis points on material buckets. But anywhere in the zone of 45 to 50 will be quite comfortable, and we will definitely keep it in that zone, but maybe inch towards 50.Q: You are also one of the few banks where deposit growth is higher than loan growth this quarter, but the credit-deposit  ratio is still high at 93%.",

Within that strategy, housing finance plays a critical role, offering long-tenure, secured assets and relatively predictable cash flows compared with unsecured credit.The proposed Advent investment comes at a time when housing finance companies  are consciously building capital buffers. After a period of cautious lending post the pandemic, demand for home loans, especially in the affordable and mid-income segments, has remained resilient, driven by urbanisation, infrastructure-led development and policy support for housing.At the same time, regulators and rating agencies have been emphasising capital adequacy and liability diversification, pushing lenders to rely less on short-term market borrowings and more on stable equity capital. Separately, the parent, Aditya Birla Capital, infused ₹249 crore into the subsidiary to support growth and improve leverage metrics, following earlier capital support as well.Diversification of capital baseAgainst this backdrop, sources said Advent’s proposed investment would further diversify the capital base, reducing reliance on periodic parent infusions and debt issuances.For Advent, the investment would signal continued conviction in India’s secured retail credit story, even as the firm has monetised parts of its earlier exposure to Aditya Birla Capital at the parent level. For Aditya Birla Housing Finance, the capital could provide the firepower needed to scale up lending, deepen presence in priority housing segments and navigate asset-quality cycles from a position of strength.Both the companies did not immediately respond to CNBC-TV18's queries.",

It noted that the Budget’s growth orientation was visible in the strong thrust on capital expenditure and sectoral priorities such as semiconductors, rare earth magnets, industrial clusters, data centres, and services exports. The fiscal deficit for FY27 is budgeted at 4.3% of GDP compared to 4.4% in FY26 Revised Estimates, while central government debt is projected at 55.6% of GDP. It alsi pointed out that total capital expenditure is set to rise 11.5% YoY in F2027, while defence capex is budgeted to increase 18% YoY. Morgan Stanley said, “We expect the Budget to support cyclical growth recovery through its emphasis on capex (central government capex stays at 3.1% of GDP in F27, similar to F26 RE) and to strengthen India’s structural growth trend through steps that improve manufacturing competitiveness and services sector attractiveness.”\nThe brokerage concluded that the combination of sustained capex, structural reforms in manufacturing and services, and a calibrated fiscal path could support earnings growth into F2027.",

He said, “The cost will be up by three bps.” He added that after including rollover and portfolio churn costs, the overall impact on returns could be higher.He said, “The impact should be around 30 to 32 bps.” The revised STT rates will be effective from April 1, and Jain said the impact will start reflecting in returns after that.Also Read | STT shock could backfire, hurt liquidity and FPI appeal: Rajesh BahetiHe said arbitrage funds may try to recover part of the increased cost by seeking better rollover spreads. However, he said some impact on returns is unavoidable.Jain said arbitrage funds may still remain more tax-efficient compared to liquid funds. He said the post-tax return gap between arbitrage funds and liquid funds may narrow but will remain in favour of arbitrage funds.He added that there will be no immediate impact before April as most positions have already been rolled over. He said the STT increase may also impact other hybrid products such as balanced advantage funds, equity savings funds and hybrid long-short funds, though the impact may be smaller.Jain also said arbitrage funds cannot shift trades to options as regulations require them to use single stock futures for arbitrage strategies.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

        "condensed_text": "Free trade agreements  with the United Kingdom  and Europe could be a game-changer for India’s textile and apparel industry, delivering a profitability boost far bigger than most Budget measures, said Punit Lalbhai, Vice Chairman of Arvind.Lalbhai said the ongoing trade negotiations are a very big deal for the sector and could materially alter the economics of garment exports. “It’s almost 10–12% in a net 6–7–8% business overall,” he said, pointing out how meaningful the impact of FTAs could be for an industry that typically operates on thin margins.He added that, while the ratification process may take time, these agreements can help fundamentally change India’s position in the global textile value chain — moving the country away from being largely an upstream yarn and fabric supplier to becoming a much stronger garments exporter.Alongside trade agreements, Lalbhai said the government has continued to create a supportive policy environment for the industry through initiatives announced in the Union Budget. Referring to measures such as the National Fibre Scheme and the development of mega textile parks, he said, “The importance is to grow the ecosystem in India, especially around garment making, and I think these mega textile parks are definitely a step in the right direction.”Also Read: Arvind Fashions targets sustained growth through retail and online push: Kulin LalbhaiWith the policy framework now in place, Lalbhai stressed that the responsibility lies with companies to capitalise on the opportunity. And going forward, we should be able to double our presence in these markets,” he said, adding that this diversification would help cushion the business against geopolitical and tariff-related uncertainties.Also Read: Budget 2026: Finance Minister Sitharaman proposes integrated programme to boost textile sectorDespite global trade concerns, Lalbhai said the company delivered a strong performance in the October-December quarter of 2025 . Growth was led by the advanced materials business, which expanded by almost 30% quarter-on-quarter, and the garments division, which grew 22%.Addressing worries over possible margin pressure if US tariffs continue, Lalbhai said the company has managed the impact through a mix of selective price adjustments, higher volumes, internal cost efficiencies and support from a favourable dollar exchange rate.“We should be able to continue this trajectory even if tariffs remain where they are,” he said, describing the overall outlook for the business and the sector as one of “cautious optimism.”For the entire interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

The index would need to move past the 50-EMA zone at the 59,000 level in the coming sessions, and on the downside, as mentioned earlier, would have the important and crucial support positioned near the significant 200-period MA at the 56,800 zone, which needs to be sustained to maintain the overall trend intact.”\nParekh stated that immediate support for the Nifty 50 index is located at 24,900, while the resistance level is at 25,300. 1] IOC: Buy at ₹ 163, Target ₹ 170, Stop Loss ₹ 159;\n2] Ambuja Cements: Buy at ₹ 507, Target ₹ 525, Stop Loss ₹ 497; and\n3] Deep Industries: Buy at ₹ 367, Target ₹ 385, Stop Loss ₹ 350.",

Reliance Industries share price rallied 7.11% to ₹ 1489 apiece on the BSE in the morning trade, cutting the year-to-date (YTD) losses to 8%. \"Even though India has reduced its purchase of crude oil from Russia in recent months, it is unlikely to cease all purchases immediately, which could be disruptive to India’s economic growth,\" Moody's was quoted as saying by Reuters . Commenting on the rise in Reliance Industries shares today, Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS, said the recent move appears to reflect a broader market re-rating linked to India–US strategic engagement. As a result, near-term refining margin volatility is being viewed as cyclical rather than structural, Dasani opined, adding that the company could benefit from the India-US trade deal that strengthens the longer-term narrative around energy cooperation, technology partnerships, and capital inflows.",

He added that an extra 25% tariff penalty earlier imposed over India’s continued Russian oil imports would now be withdrawn.Shah said the move removes a key worry for markets and could support sectors that were directly hit earlier, such as textiles, aquaculture, handicrafts, and gems and jewellery. But while the broad mood has improved, the real impact will depend on how the fine print shapes sector-wise benefits.Indian markets opened sharply higher on February 3, with the Nifty jumping nearly 1,200 points at the open. The Sensex followed a similar trend, rising around 2,000 points and heading towards the 83,400 level.Shah pointed out that timing could work in India’s favour in terms of flows.“There are reasons for investors to be optimistic about earnings growth,” he said, as growth is seen recovering from single digits to double digits in the next financial year. “Time in the market is what makes money for you, not timing the market.”The message is simple: the mood has turned, but sustainable gains will depend on how earnings actually play out.",

The court had stated that the issue involved larger constitutional questions that needed to be examined by it.The ED on January 8 conducted searches at the office of the Indian Political Action Committee  and the home of its director, Pratik Jain, in Kolkata as part of a money laundering probe into an alleged multi-crore rupee coal pilferage scam.Apart from providing political consultancy to the TMC, the I-PAC also manages the party's IT and media operations.The firm's office in Salt Lake and Jain's residence on Loudon Street are among about 10 premises, including four in Delhi, being raided by the federal probe agency in the presence of central paramilitary teams.",

The brokerage pointed out that while total and own sales volumes rose 16 per cent and 5 per cent year on year, weak pricing in flat steel weighed on margins, pulling down EBITDA per tonne to ₹4,500 sequentially and compressing it slightly on a year-on-year basis.

        "condensed_text": "Shares of electronics manufacturing services (EMS) companies Dixon Technologies, Syrma SGS Technology and Kaynes Technology India rose between 5 percent and 7 percent in Tuesday’s trade after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with India, lowering tariffs on Indian goods to 18 percent. According to ICICI Securities, lower US tariffs could benefit EMS exporters such asDixon Technologies,Kaynes Technologyand Syrma SGS by enhancing export competitiveness and supporting margins. India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) President Ashok Chandak said the India-US trade deal could act as a major catalyst for India’s electronics, semiconductor and technology ecosystem. Chandak added that, when complemented by initiatives such as iCET and TRUST, the deal could help strengthen trusted supply chains and deepen technology collaboration between the two countries.

        "condensed_text": "Billionaire Mukesh Ambani backed Reliance Industries shares jumped 7% to the day’s high of Rs 1,489 on BSE on Tuesday after American President Donald Trump signalled that India will start buying crude oil from Venezuela as part of a landmark trade deal under which tariffs have been cut from 50% to 18%. In 2024 Indian refiners imported an average of about 70,000 barrels per day from Venezuela with shipments exceeding 150,000 bpd in two months according to Kpler shipping data. “Venezuelan crudes are heavy and sour and therefore cheaper and would be of interest to Indian refiners many of whom can process these types of crudes,” said Prashant Vasisht Senior Vice President and Co Group Head Corporate Ratings at ICRA Ltd . Minimal impact from Russian crude exit Vasisht noted that for the Indian refining sector there are ample avenues including the US to purchase crude as Russian crude accounted for less than 2% of Indian crude imports prior to FY2023. Iranian barrels that once accounted for about 10% of India’s crude imports were replaced by supplies from the US and other producers after 2019 demonstrating India’s ability to swiftly reconfigure its crude sourcing strategy.",

So, it's almost double,\" he added.Explaining how the policy shift feeds directly into the growth outlook, Kalyani said a large part of the company’s product portfolio is expected to benefit from a lower and more uniform tariff structure. “We believe almost everything will come under 18%,” he said, referring to the new duty regime expected to apply to most exports.Also Read: US tariff relief could bring textile orders back to India from BangladeshHe added that talks are also underway between the two governments to extend the same 18% treatment to products currently covered under the higher national security tariffs under Section 232, a move that could further support the company’s passenger vehicle components business.While outlining the growth roadmap, Kalyani acknowledged that the company has recently gone through a weak demand cycle in its most important overseas market. “All indications are that in the coming quarter, we will see about a 20-25% rise in our exports compared to the last quarter, and then another 20-25% rise in the quarter after that,” Kalyani said, adding that demand is expected to return to 100% of the originally anticipated levels within the next two quarters.Also Read: Budget strengthens supply chains and manufacturing base, say auto industry executivesOn the defence side, Kalyani said the company continues to see growth opportunities, although the pace will depend on how quickly government decisions move. He added that, due to the ongoing silent period ahead of financial results, he was unable to share more forward-looking details for the defence business.For the entire interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

So, on balance, from the commodity side, there has been a little bit of inflation, which we have taken action on early January to plough those back.Now, as we move forward, the softness in the Indian rupee has been very helpful, and with the rupee trading at 90 plus to the dollar, that is a very significant tailwind.

An early onset of summer in southern India and a healthy order book underpin the company’s confidence of meeting its full-year guidance, even as January demand remained soft due to excess stocking in December.In October-December quarter , PG Electroplast reported revenue of ₹ 1,412 crore, profit after tax ₹60 crore and margins at 8.30%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: Is there a possibility that you can out beat this guidance - 17 to 19% revenue growth and the PAT number from ₹300 crores for FY26?A: I would like to stick to the revenue guidance that we have given of ₹5,800 crore. Is that correct?A: Yes.Q: This time was a room air conditioning  business, but I understand there was an account of the energy changes which come in, and there was a channel filling so going forward in quarter four or first half of FY27 which is also sort of the peak market for you, what kind of growth should we expect for the RAC business?A: I would look at quarter three, where the brands were picking up lot of inventory because of the price increase in the models of different air conditioners based on the rating energy table change. So that led to the good growth of AC sales in our quarter three numbers, and December was one of the best sales months for us, for air conditioners.We feel going forward in in in the quarter four of FY26 we are seeing that the inventory is still there in the channel, and that inventory still needs to be picked up. We remain optimistic based on the guidance and the based of the order book that we have with us from our clients.Q: What's the update on the compressor JV, we have been talking about that in the past, but what is the latest?A: I would say the compressor thing is still moving, and we are hopeful that we should be able to close in next, I would say, three to four weeks.",

Speaking to analysts on January 30 about the strategy, Bajaj Auto executive director Rakesh Sharma said following the festival season, the company accelerated its launch and refresh cycle. He added that seven interventions in the form of upgrades and refreshes have been rolled out over the past two months, helping drive growth and market share in a favourable demand environment. “By the end of this period, the entire Pulsar portfolio would be a complete, potent, and persuasive portfolio,” Sharma said, adding the company expects to outpace industry growth in the 125cc-plus segment, especially in the 150cc-plus category, and continue gaining market share. The company is also exploring entry into new motorcycle formats, including on-road and off-road bikes, either through a new brand or by reviving one of its dormant brands.",

The sharp jump in net profit was largely driven by a one-time exceptional gain from the sale of its stake in Adani Wilmar. During the quarter ended December 31, 2025, the parent entity, ACLLP, sold 13% of AWL’s paid-up equity share capital to Lenee Pte Limited under a share purchase agreement and divested the remaining 7% stake through market transactions. As a result, the group recognised an exceptional gain of ₹ 5,632.09 crore (post-tax gain of ₹ 4,661.11 crore). Meanwhile, its consolidated revenue from operations during the reporting quarter stood at ₹ 24,819 crore, marking an 8.6% year-on-year increase from ₹ 22,848 crore.",

        "condensed_text": "India’s listed Real Estate Investment Trusts  and Infrastructure Investment Trusts  emerged as one of the best-performing asset classes in calendar year 2025, significantly outperforming traditional market benchmarks, according to data released by ICRA Analytics based on InfRE360 and NSE data.On an equal-weight basis, listed REITs and InvITs delivered a combined return of 19.55% in 2025, well ahead of the Nifty50 Total Return Index  at 11.42% and the G-Sec Index at 6.81%. In contrast, Road InvITs lagged with a 6.55% return, weighed down by asset-specific challenges and the impact of new listings.ICRA Analytics noted that these figures are based on an equal-weight methodology across all listed entities, rather than market-cap weighting, and include both capital appreciation and distributions. December 2025 distributions are yet to be credited, which could further lift overall returns.According to Madhubani Sengupta, Head – Knowledge Services, ICRA Analytics, the year-on-year trend shows mixed movement within the trusts space, even as the overall category strengthened.“REITs nearly doubled their returns, rising from 16.81% in 2024 to 29.68% in 2025, reflecting sustained leasing momentum and consistent yield profiles. Power InvITs advanced from 9.43% to 20.22%, while Road InvITs dipped from 9.49% to 6.55%, highlighting divergent performance across infrastructure-linked assets,” Sengupta said.She added that the interest rate environment in 2025 shifted investor preference away from G-Secs towards equity-linked and income-generating instruments. As a result, sovereign bonds underperformed, while listed trusts continued to attract strong demand due to predictable cash flows, competitive yields, and rising interest in real estate- and infrastructure-backed investments.ICRA Analytics said public trusts have positioned themselves as a resilient alternative to traditional equities and fixed-income products, particularly for investors seeking regular distributions alongside capital appreciation.",

State-run NMDC Ltd. reported results for the December quarter that were higher than the same quarter on the revenue front, but lower across other parameters. The operating performance also turned out to be lower than what the street was anticipating.Revenue for the quarter grew by 16% year-on-year to ₹7,610.8 crore compared to ₹6,568 crore earlier. A ramp-up in the pellet business has aided the growth in topline with revenue increasing to ₹1,537 crore from ₹931 crore in the previous quarter.Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation  for the quarter of ₹2,144.3 crore, was down 9.6% from last year and in-line with the CNBC-TV18 poll expectation of ₹2,119 crore.EBITDA margin for the quarter narrowed to 28.2% from 36.1% last year. The sharp drop in margins could be attributed to a 70% jump in other expenses and 65% jump in selling expenses.NMDC has also incorporated an arm to acquisition, exploration, production and other related activities of critical minerals.Shares of NMDC are trading little changed after the earnings announcement, currently trading 0.2% higher at ₹81.65.",

(SPARC) on Tuesday said the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has granted a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) linked to the approval of its neonatal seizure therapy Sezaby, giving the drug developer a potentially valuable strategic tool to accelerate future medicines. PRVs are tradable vouchers issued by the USFDA to incentivize development of treatments for rare pediatric conditions, and can be redeemed to secure a priority review for a separate, future drug application—often shaving months off the review clock for high-value assets. SPARC said it intends to use the voucher to “further accelerate” its pipeline, signaling it may either deploy the PRV internally for a key program or potentially monetize it depending on strategic needs. “Receiving this Priority Review Voucher is a significant milestone for SPARC and a testament to our commitment to addressing the urgent, unmet needs of patients,” said Anil Raghavan, CEO of SPARC. “This award not only recognizes the therapeutic value of Sezaby but also provides SPARC with additional strategic flexibility to accelerate our pipeline development to bring more therapies to patients faster.”\nThe PRV is associated with Sezaby, which SPARC described as a benzyl alcohol- and propylene glycol–free formulation of phenobarbital sodium powder for injection, approved by the USFDA for the treatment of neonatal seizures—a clinical setting where safety considerations around excipients can be particularly important.",

One of the most notable outcomes of this strategy was the scaling up of Santoor, which grew into India’s largest soap brand over the years.In a LinkedIn post marking his retirement, the company said Agrawal’s leadership was defined by clarity, long-term thinking and a strong emphasis on values. It credited him with building a culture rooted in fairness, trust and diverse perspectives, while remaining deeply involved in day-to-day business decisions.The company recently held an internal event to commemorate Agrawal’s journey, with employees and leaders coming together to reflect on his contribution to the organisation and its culture.Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting has announced Kumar Chander as the new CEO, with Chander also taking over as Managing Director of Wipro Enterprises.

The brokerage’s commentary may have reignited investor unease over unrelated diversification, particularly at a time when the company’s India business continues to deliver strong growth, profitability and market dominance, and when the original investment thesis was firmly anchored in domestic scale rather than overseas expansion. “When a company is growing its India revenues at over 40 percent, commands more than 90 percent market share in its core line of business, and accounts for close to 25 percent of the term and retail health insurance market, the investment narrative is usually built around deepening domestic dominance rather than geographic expansion,” Macquarie said. Insurance revenues grew 39 percent, total insurance premiums rose 45 percent, and growth was led by the protection business, which expanded 68 percent year-on-year, and the new health insurance business, which grew 79 percent. Macquarie said the company has called a board meeting to seek approval for a qualified institutional placement (QIP) to fund strategic investments, acquisitions or partnerships in local or international markets, with management stating that a target has already been identified.",

Shaadi.com founder and Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal has weighed into the ongoing debate around Gen Z job-hopping, calling out what he describes as “career gurus” for shaming young professionals who switch roles frequently in their early 20s. “Early in our careers, we’re essentially dating industries, roles, and cultures to find what fits,” Mittal wrote, adding that young professionals should not feel guilty about moving on if a role doesn’t align with their interests. “When I’m hiring for senior leadership or Level 1 roles, I almost always reject resumes that don’t show at least one four-to-five-year stint,” he said. Based on his experience as a founder and investor, Mittal outlined a simple career framework -- one should explore aggressively and even switch roles, if needed, and identify what they genuinely enjoy when they are 21-24 years old. He concluded by emphasising that while it may take a year to understand a job, it takes three to five years to truly understand an industry—“and that’s when you really start to win.”\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.",

What is the reason for that and when can we expect a recovery?A:  We are a business we should be tracked on last twelve months , not quarter-on-quarter, because single licence revenue could be as high as ₹50 crore to ₹100 crore, difference can create a marginal  difference. Where revenue grew 23% on LTM basis, my margin grew 33% on LTM basis, my cash position move 49% year-to-year.Now this is a phenomenal quarter from our internal perspective, quarterly number we cannot manage, and we don't want to manage because the deal size are big, contracts are complex and they cannot be tracked on 90 day period.Q: Since we are not talking about quarterly numbers on of FY26 basis and FY27 basis, now if you have some visibility, what kind of margins are you looking at? In terms of growth as well what kind of deal wins and growth are you looking at?A: If I look at it, our three businesses, which we started, global transaction banking  business is a ₹1,400 crore business, consumer banking  business, we started in 2018 that is close to ₹1,000 crore - ₹960 crore. Our geography distribution is America, which is giving 25% revenue, it will be close to ₹1000 crore with a new deal signing it up, it will further accelerate.Europe is another, 25% revenue comes from there, and rest of 50% comes from Middle East.",

        "condensed_text": "Shares of Gokaldas Exports surged for the second straight session on Wednesday, rallying as much as 19% to touch a day’s high of Rs 825 on the BSE. The apparel manufacturer’s stock has zoomed nearly 40% in the last two sessions, fuelled by the landmark India-US trade deal that has slashed tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from the earlier 50%. According to ICICI Direct, the significant reduction in US tariffs positions Gokaldas Exports with a distinct first mover advantage, given that nearly 80% of its revenues are derived from the US market. \"Q3FY26 was the first full quarter impacted by the steep 50% US tariff on India and the expiry of AGOA which provided duty-free access from Africa to the US,\" the company said in its investor presentation. \"We expect normalisation of Africa business, increasing business from EU and UK driven by FTA... and reduction in tariff in US to 18% from 50% earlier will help revenues to grow at CAGR of 12% over FY25-28E,\" the brokerage noted.",

PCBL reported consolidated revenue of Rs18.5bn in Q3FY26, down 15% QoQ and 8% YoY, driven by a 13% QoQ and 2% YoY decline in carbon black volumes and a sharp fall in realization to Rs104. The power segment also witnessed a 27% QoQ decline in revenue to Rs779mn, largely due to lower CB production, while the Aquapharm (Chemicals) segment reported a 17% decline in topline sequentially amid geopolitical tensions. Looking ahead, we expect carbon black volumes to grow by 2% in FY26 and 11% in FY27, supported by new capacity additions; however, EBITDA/t is likely to remain subdued at ~Rs15,545 in FY26 and ~Rs17,100 in FY27, reflecting sustained pricing pressure.

Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd will continue to monitor the security situation in the Middle East region very closely, and any alteration to the Gemini service will remain dependent on the ongoing stability in the Red Sea area and the absence of any escalation in conflicts in the region, Maersk said.

Partner exits at VC funds are not new and uncommon, but when several of its top-performing partners exit in quick succession, fund sponsors – or limited partners (LPs) – ask tougher  questions around future bets and on the potential to earn outsized returns from them. Peak XV will make a total of around Rs 17,300 crore (around $2 billion) on an investment of just Rs 230 crore (about $26 million as per the USD/INR exchange rate six years ago), a 75X return in record time, as per current stock prices. Of the total stake,Peak has already pocketed gains of around Rs 1,500 crore(around $180 million), by selling shares as part of the offer for sale (OFS) component during Groww’s IPO in November, already an 8X returns, and it still continues to hold a significant share in the company, as per a-back-of-the envelope calculation. While Peak XV internally promoted Abhishek Mohan to Managing Director and General Partner from Principal in the venture team and Saipriya Sarangan has been elevated to chief operating officer from chief people officer as part of its announcement yesterday, it remains to be seen how Singh and GV restore stability and boost investor confidence in the coming months.",

The initial hit was to Software as a Service firms, but the fear quickly spread to outsourcing and IT services companies seen as closely linked to global tech spending.Moshe Katri, MD – FinTech &amp; Tech-Enabled Services Investment Banking at Wedbush Securities, however, believes markets may be getting ahead of the evidence. “I think the sell-off is overdone,” he said, noting that many technology companies have still delivered better-than-expected earnings and guidance in recent quarters.“If you look at most companies reporting in the past few weeks, they’ve done better than expected. “The sector is very well positioned from the infrastructure side of AI, massaging the data, preparing it to basically get fed into those accelerators.” At the same time, he added that “it’s going to take some time until those projects really gain traction.”He linked the sector’s prolonged underperformance largely to sentiment. “The underperformance continues to be a function of sentiment,” he said, adding that “the next 12 months will probably be better than the last 12 months.”Also Read: See 40-70% upside in Indian IT stocks as sector nears business cycle turn: Motilal Oswal's Abhishek PathakFor the entire discussion, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

        "condensed_text": "Electric power generation company ACME Solar Holdings has laid out ambitious growth trajectory, underpinned by a significant capital expenditure plan and a pipeline of projects with higher power purchase agreement  tariffs than its existing operational assetsNikhil Dhingra, CEO, ACME Solar Holdings said, “There is a large capex happening. 1.5 gigawatt translates into around thre3e gigawatts of operational capacity which will be executed in this year.”The new projects will benefit from higher tariffs and significantly better power generation, as the plants being built are expected to operate at utilisation levels of over 50%, compared with 25–30% for traditional solar projects. This means the upcoming 1.5 gigawatts of capacity could deliver output similar to the company’s existing 3 gigawatts of operational capacity.The company is also constructing around 2.6 gigawatts of projects backed by signed PPAs, while another 1.4 gigawatts is expected to be tied up with contracts over the next few quarters. Importantly, most of the signed projects carry tariffs higher than the current average, helping protect revenue even as market tariffs trend lower in certain segments.Dhingra said, “Our business is dependent on getting new capacities, building those capacities and running them efficiently. Net debt remains at a comfortable level for a utility business, supported by long-term power purchase agreements  and predictable cash flows.In October-December quarter  ACME Solar Holdings reported revenue of ₹496 crore, and profit after tax at ₹113 crore and margins at 89.5%.While tariffs for plain battery projects have seen pressure recently, ACME Solar has largely stayed away from those bids.",

        "condensed_text": "Saugata Basuray, Interim CEO of Castrol India, says the company is positioning itself for a stronger growth cycle in the coming quarters, with a sharper focus on deeper rural penetration, expansion in industrial segments and new-age applications to drive volumes, even as the broader lubricants market grows at a steady pace.While near-term margins remain under pressure, Basuray says Castrol India is banking on operating strength, product innovation and a widening customer base to build a more resilient earnings profile in the period ahead.Castrol India, which follows a calendar-year financial reporting cycle, posted a mixed year-on-year performance for the October–December quarter of calendar year 2025. However, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation  declined 2.3% to ₹367.6 crore from ₹376 crore, reflecting pressure on profitability.The operating profit margin softened to 25.5% from 27.7% a year ago, while profit after tax fell 10% to ₹244 crore, compared with ₹271 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. There is still uncertainty around this, but have you heard anything about what changes could follow from this transaction?A: Let me first address our Q4 numbers, and then I will respond to your question.First of all, I am very pleased to say that it has been the eighth straight quarter of volume growth, and volume growth ahead of the market, which has resulted in share gain. And we have a team which is today going around the country today, introducing Castrol to customers in this segment, because that is what Castrol has not traditionally been associated with, and we have seen success on that front.Q: Do you think the industrial business grows two times of your core growth, which itself will be 1.5-2x of the industry growth?A: That is the kind of range that the industrial business has been delivering, and I expect the industrial business to sustain that level of growth.Q: You have also indicated that you are developing products for the data centre business. So very much engaged — again, a small part of our business and a small opportunity today, but positioning us for growth into the future.Also Read: Castrol India eyes 21-24% margin band as rural and industrial segments pick upQ: From a data centre standpoint, what proportion of their bill of materials  would be the product that you sell?",

        "condensed_text": "India’s electric two-wheeler market growth forecast at 16-18% as supply chains stabilise: CRISIL. MUMBAI: India’s electric two-wheeler  growth is projected to hit 16-18% in the next fiscal, supported by a structural ownership-cost advantage and stabilizing supply of rare-earth magnets, according to an analysis from CRISIL Ratings.This rebound comes after a period of moderation in the current fiscal where the growth slowed to 12-13% due to disruptions in the supply of rare-earth magnets and shifting tax policies, down from nearly 22% in the last fiscal.E2W adoption continues to be supported by strong vehicle economics. While GST rate cuts have reduced the purchase cost of ICE vehicles, running costs favour E2Ws, at ₹0.3/km versus ₹2.0-2.5/km for ICE, continuing their advantage in total cost of ownership even as subsidies taper, the analysis stated.“The supply disruption caused by shortage of rare-earth magnets had weighed on E2W volumes around mid-year. As availability began to ease, coinciding with the GST-led price revision in ICE models, OEMs relied on discounting and introduced lower-priced electric models to narrow the ICEEV price gap,” said Anuj Sethi, Senior Director, Crisil Ratings.Also Read: 11:11 | GST Reform, Impact on FMCG, Electric vehicles, and more“While this has supported a recovery in volumes in recent months, the impact of the earlier supply disruption is expected to limit full-year growth to 12-13%.”The anticipated recovery is largely driven by the easing of rare-earth magnet supplies from China and proactive steps by manufacturers to diversify their sourcing, according to Sethi.Future outlookBy the next fiscal year, E2Ws are expected to account for 7% of total two-wheeler volumes, up from 5.5%, the analysis showed. Scooters will continue to drive adoption, with EV penetration at 15%, and account for 90-95% of the E2W volume.“The market share of legacy players has increased to 62% by January 2026 from ~47% a year earlier, clearly outperforming new-age players,” said Poonam Upadhyay, Director, Crisil Ratings.Also Read: On US India deal, Goyal says energy diversification paramount for IndiaThe share gain reflected legacy players’ stronger dealer reach and supplier ecosystems, along with an expanded range of entry-level and mid-priced electric models that enables faster rollout, wider availability, and more consistent execution, Upadhyay said.",

This fiscal, the electric two-wheeler (E2W) growth is expected to moderate due to temporary disruptions in the supply of rare-earth magnets and the goods and services tax (GST) rationalisation on internal combustion engine (ICE) models, Crisil Ratings said in a statement. “With supply conditions improving, reflecting a gradual resumption of inflow of magnets from China alongside initial steps by OEMs to diversify sourcing, growth is expected to re-accelerate to 16-18 per cent next fiscal, assuming stable availability of rare-earth magnets,\" Sethi said. “An analysis of 10 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), comprising four legacy players with ICE and E2W portfolios and six new-age, EV-only players, indicates as much,\" it said, adding these OEMs account for about 85 per cent of the E2W volume. While GST rate cuts have reduced the purchase cost of ICE vehicles, running costs favour E2Ws, at about 3 paisa/km versus ₹2-2.5/km for ICE, continuing their advantage in total cost of ownership even as subsidies taper, it said.",

        "condensed_text": "What's your own estimate for FY27?A: In fact, now we are already at the end of FY26, and it's better to talk about even FY27, and we had a Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers  conclave where all the auto original equipment manufacturers  were present, and the consensus was about 5 to 6% growth for the industry. Will it stay around this 11.2–11.3% sort of band despite commodity inflation?A: During our Investor Day, we have already given guidance that our EBITDA margins will stay between 11% and 14%, and we are fairly confident of meeting those expectations going forward as well.Q: Is there another price hike on the anvil?A: Ideally, we don't want to do price hikes, and we always try to do cost optimisation. The demographics of India, a very strong plant structure, and a very high level of quality put us in a very good position to continuously look for opportunities for increasing exports.Also Read | PG Electroplast holds FY26 target, waits for channel inventory to clear, summer salesHyundai has been very strong in India in terms of exporting since the time we set foot in India. So, the plans are very much intact, and we are fairly confident that exports will only go up from here.Q: Since you spoke about increased capacity helping your exports, could you tell us what your current capacity utilisation is, and when do you get to this 30% contribution coming in from exports?A: The current capacity is now almost 824,000 in Chennai and 170,000 in Pune. The current level is about 23 to 24%.Q: Lastly, could you talk to us about the strategy behind the foray into the commercial mobility segment?A: I think this is a very interesting segment, and we have seen the segment really grow, especially post COVID, in the last three to four years, when people are looking for shared mobility.",

        "condensed_text": "Despite the gems and jewellery sector facing sustained pressure for more than a year, Rajiv Anand, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of IndusInd Bank, said the bank’s exposure to the segment continues to remain asset-quality stable, with no accounts slipping into stress categories.The gems and jewellery portfolio accounts for around 3% of the bank’s total loan book, or roughly ₹9,500 crore. The sector, he said, has gone through a difficult phase over the past 12 to 18 months, mainly due to tariff-related issues and a sharp drop in demand from China after the pandemic.However, Anand underlined that the bank has not seen any slippages in this portfolio. Reflecting the muted operating environment, he said the bank’s loan book to the gems and jewellery sector has not grown over the past year.Anand said the recently concluded US–India trade deal, which fixes a flat tariff of 18%, is a clear positive for the industry and should support exports going ahead. Even so, he cautioned that it is still too early to estimate how much incremental lending could emerge from this improvement, and the bank will first engage with its existing clients before firming up growth plans.On the bank’s broader micro, small, and medium enterprises  portfolio with exposure to US exports, Anand said the impact of tariffs has been relatively muted, as many borrowers had already diversified their buyer base.Also Read: Budget borrowing surprise may nudge yields up, RBI support expected: IndusInd Bank CEOResponding to questions around recent senior management appointments and organisational changes, Anand said the bank continues to follow all regulatory and disclosure requirements and will keep informing stock exchanges whenever senior personnel join.On capital, Anand said the bank remains comfortably placed, with a capital adequacy ratio of 17% and a Common Equity Tier-1 ratio of 15.8%. So therefore, to that extent, we don't envisage a capital raise in the near to medium term,” he said, ruling out any immediate plans to raise capital.For the entire interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

        "condensed_text": "Emcure Pharmaceuticals reported a strong set of December-quarter earnings, with consolidated net profit jumping 50% year-on-year to ₹230.5 crore, aided by robust revenue growth across domestic and international markets and margin expansion, despite a one-time hit from labour code-related costs.The company, in an exchange filing on Wednesday, February 4, said that its revenue from operations rose 20.4% from last year to ₹2,363 crore in the December quarter, compared with ₹1,962 crore a year earlier.Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortisation  climbed 39% from the year-ago period to ₹493 crore, while operating margin expanded to 20.8% from 18% in the same period last year.According to Emcure Pharma, profit growth was driven by strong traction across key therapies in India and sustained momentum in overseas markets. Domestic formulations revenue increased 15.4% from last year to ₹1,025 crore, led by chronic segments such as cardio and diabetes, while international business grew 24.5% to ₹1,338 crore, with broad-based growth across regions.Emcure’s Rest of the World business rose 30.7%, while Europe and Canada posted growth of 29.6% and 12.8%, respectively.

He added that the fresh budget allocation is a positive development and that payment-related bottlenecks, which had forced engineering, procurement and construction  companies to slow execution, are now easing. “Now that the payments have started coming in, I’m sure that we will see a lot of traction,” he said.Also Read: Data centre expansion fuels new growth avenue for Welspun Corp, says Vipul MathurWelspun Corp’s direct exposure to JJM, he added, is relatively small at under ₹100 crore and is largely with government entities, making it a secure exposure.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation  is fairly strong, but a large part of that has to do with the deconsolidation of the sports business and some of the acquisitions that you've made over the course of the last year as well. And the best part is that our cost per acquisition has come down from $37 to $35.4, so we've been able to spend more but at lower costs, which makes us feel that we can get growth going strongly in the coming quarters.Also Read | A made-in-India global gaming powerhouse: CEO Nitish Mittersain's ambition for NazaraQ: In terms of the investments that you're making in the business so far, what has been the total dollar value of investments that you've made in the company so far, and will you be making more? A good part of that is that they will support all these studios that we acquire and add a lot of synergy and value to them.Q: The dollar value of total investments that you've made in the company so far — because organic growth is at around 10% — one sense is that you'll be raising funds for funding growth going forward. And if we require additional capital, we will raise capital.What we are very focused on is to ensure that if there is any capital raise and there is dilution to the shareholders, the accretion in terms of cash flows from the businesses that we acquire is far more rewarding than the dilution.",

        "condensed_text": "Amit Ramani, Chairman and Managing Director of Awfis Space Solutions, remains confident about the company’s growth trajectory, reiterating its guidance of around 30% overall growth for FY26.He highlighted that the co-working and allied services segment continues to outperform, driven by strong demand momentum and increasing adoption by enterprises seeking flexible workspace solutions.Ramani attributed this momentum largely to the accelerating adoption of flexible workspaces by Global Capability Centres , especially first-time entrants into India.He explained that co-working has increasingly become the preferred first port of call for such companies, as it allows them to set up operations quickly without committing to long-term real estate investments, while also offering scalability as teams expand.In October-December quarter , Awfis Space Solutions reported revenues of ₹382 crore, profit after tax of ₹22 crore and margins at 36.5%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: Can you give us a sense of what the FY26 outlook is looking like? The growth in every sector related to GCCs, as well as if you look at now, even with the Budget, with the AI and the data centre companies, and this solutioning that is going to provide tax holidays is only going to help and improve the sector.Q: You have 152,000 seats, when do we expect this number to double from here?A: So last year, we added about 40,000 seats. So, 32,000 for this year, next year, we will provide that guidance in the next quarter itself.Q: Since you said you are at the highest level of commercial rentals, even volumes and pricing are going in tandem, so I wanted to understand, what would the risk to some of the big opportunities that there are in the industry currently? So, the growth engines and the drivers for co-working, overall, for commercial real estate, are very strong.For co-working, it's a first port of call, especially for the first time GCCs, they do not have their teams in India, and as a result, co-working and flex provides a great solutioning. But I think there is a very clear approach that we are taking where we have to balance the seat addition with the growth and the profitability at the same time.If you look at our numbers, we did about ₹22 crores of PAT at this point, and for the year or nine month period, we are almost ₹50 crores of PAT.",

Jain said that the current movement in OMC stocks like BPCL, HPCL, and IOC is a result of the market digesting the strong tailwinds from the earlier drop in crude prices, which delivered materially higher gross refining margins and robust profitability in Q3FY2026. “That earnings strength, combined with a healthy rebound in petroleum product volumes driven by seasonal demand and economic pickup, plus the welcome absence of any excise duty hike in the recent Budget, has removed a major overhang and kept investor sentiment supportive,” Jain added. “From a structural perspective, the previous breakout zone near 350–355 now acts as a key support base,” Shah explains, adding that as long as the price holds this region, the structure remains valid for a potential move toward the “395–420 target zone,” he added.",

Jain said that the current movement in OMC stocks like BPCL, HPCL, and IOC is a result of the market digesting the strong tailwinds from the earlier drop in crude prices, which delivered materially higher gross refining margins and robust profitability in Q3FY2026. “That earnings strength, combined with a healthy rebound in petroleum product volumes driven by seasonal demand and economic pickup, plus the welcome absence of any excise duty hike in the recent Budget, has removed a major overhang and kept investor sentiment supportive,” Jain added. “From a structural perspective, the previous breakout zone near 350–355 now acts as a key support base,” Shah explains, adding that as long as the price holds this region, the structure remains valid for a potential move toward the “395–420 target zone,” he added.",

        "condensed_text": "Staffing firmTeamLease Servicesreported a nearly 47% surge in third-quarter profit on February 4, driven by demand from global capability centres (GCC) for specialised staff. Revenue from the general staffing business, which contributes to over 90% of the total, rose 1.2% and was impacted by insourcing by a client in the banking and financial services division, the company said. \"Despite general slowness in the economy, our new logo acquisition is stable, including the GCC wins...Full impact of BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) headcount loss will be absorbed by Q1FY27,\" Managing Director Ashok Reddy said in a statement. Analysts previously said that staffing firms will benefit in the medium to long term from new labour codes, as simplified compliance norms will help reduce administration costs and could lead to more formalisation of India's workforce, leading to increased business. TeamLease said its profit for the period was not impacted as the impact of the changes in labour codes for billable employees is recoverable from customers and doesn't impact its bottom line.",

        "condensed_text": "N Kamakodi, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of City Union Bank, says the bank is positioning itself for sustained mid-to-high teen loan growth over the coming quarters, led by secured lending across micro, small and medium enterprises , gold loans, agriculture and secured retail, while remaining cautious on unsecured expansion as it prioritises balance-sheet stability.The forward momentum is supported by a strong operating performance in the October-December quarter of 2025 , with net interest income rising 28% year-on-year to ₹752 crore, pre-provision operating profit up 17.7% at ₹513 crore and profit after tax  growing 16.1% to ₹332 crore.The bank’s market capitalisation stands at about ₹21,643.30 crore, and its shares have gained close to 66% over the past one year.Below are the edited excerpts from the interview.Q: You have given the street a guidance of growing in the mid to high teens, 15% to 20%, kind of growth. And specifically, in unsecured, how much headroom do you have, given some of the asset quality pressures that lenders have been telling us seem to have abated?A: We have always concentrated more on the secured front, starting with the MSMEs, commercial trading, and we added secured retail, particularly housing loans, loan against the property , rental discounting and all.So, from 2024 onwards, we have started building up the team, and around the end of the calendar year , we were able to see growth improving. And we have not gone in a significant way, unsecured retail, so far, and that strategy will stay for many more quarters to come before, if at all, we see on that line.Also Read: Budget 2026 | PSU bank mergers, capital rule changes on the table as India aims for bigger global banks: DFS SecretaryBut as of now, we are going purely on secured lending on MSMEs, commercial trading, gold loans and agriculture, along with now the secured retail of, let’s say, housing loans, LAP and other things.So, we feel we are spending some time on setting up the team. So, could you give us a sense of margins, based on all these factors?A: As you rightly said, we started fixed-rate gold loans a year before last, and the entire gold loan portfolio has, by and large, converted into a fixed-rate portfolio already. As we discussed in the con-call, over the next two to three quarters, whatever term deposits are maturing and repricing at lower rates, we will get the benefit to compensate for whatever yield reduction is happening on the asset side because of the repo cut.So overall, we are confident that whatever margin we currently have is sustainable, with a plus or minus 10 basis points.Q: The credit-deposit  ratio is at 86%, are you comfortable with that and your guidance for what kind of deposit growth would you have?A: The deposit growth will definitely be in tune with the credit growth, so that there will not be any stoppage in credit because of the non-availability of deposits.",

        "condensed_text": "Emcure Pharmaceuticalsposted a 48 percent year‑on‑year jump in net profit for the December quarter, led by strong international business momentum and improving operating leverage, even as the company absorbed a one‑time labour‑code related expense. Profit after tax rose to Rs 231 crore in Q3FY26 from Rs.156 crore a year earlier, despite an exceptional expense of Rs 38 crore linked to labour code changes. The company’s international sales—now representing more than half its revenue—rose 24.5 percent YoY to Rs 1,338 crore, with every major geography reporting double‑digit growth. A major contributor this quarter was the launch of Poviztra, a biological injectable semaglutide licensed from Novo Nordisk, giving Emcure a foothold in India’s fast‑growing weight‑management and obesity‑care market. “The Novo Nordisk partnership has given Emcure an early‑entry advantage, positioning us well in the fast‑growing obesity segment,” Mehta said.",

The quarterly profit growth was driven by a 16 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) rise in advances,  on the back of MSME loans and fixed-rate gold loans, which also helped improve yield on advances. “We are on a transformation journey, and have seen growth momentum further accelerating in this quarter with growth in total business, profitability and reaching highest-ever quarterly net profit levels,” Salee S Nair, MD & CEO, Tamilnad Mercantile Bank Ltd, told media persons. A robust 60 per cent+ growth in personal gold loans portfolio (secured), which help shield banks from the impact of ‘repo rate cuts’ have also helped, he noted. Among other digital initiatives, helping the bank improve CASA and collections, TMB said it has established a “state-of-the-art Call Centre with AI calling facility” to enhance customer service and support capabilities.",

        "condensed_text": "The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Wednesday ordered a detailed investigation against IndiGo for alleged unfair business practices, nearly two months after the country’s largest airline cancelled thousands of flights, disrupting travel plans for lakhs of passengers. After examining airline data and inputs from the aviation regulator DGCA, the watchdog said it had prima facie found that IndiGo abused its dominant position in the domestic aviation market, according to a report by PTI. ‘Artificial scarcity’ flagged\nIn its 16-page order, the CCI said that IndiGo’s mass cancellation of flights, accounting for a significant share of scheduled capacity, amounted to withholding services from the market during a period of peak demand. Such conduct, the regulator said, may have created “artificial scarcity” and limited consumer access to air travel, potentially violating Section 4(2)(b)(i) of the Competition Act, which deals with abuse of dominance, PTI reported. While regulators such as DGCA oversee licensing, safety and operational supervision, they do not conduct competition law analysis, including market delineation, dominance assessment or evaluation of adverse effects on competition, the CCI said, PTI reported.",

        "condensed_text": "Shares of Indian IT companies slumped on February 4 after US artificial intelligence firm Anthropic’s launch of a legal AI tool reignited fears around rising competition and the impact of AI on traditional IT services and software companies. “If you’re talking about a greenfield estate, where you’re building a new IT setup from scratch, productivity can be very high because it’s all new architecture and new languages,” he said. “But if you’re talking about a legacy estate, which is what 99 per cent of enterprises have, the productivity numbers are much more modest.”\nHe added that the scale of the market reaction appeared disproportionate to recent developments. It feels like a massive overreaction to nothing that has materially changed over the past two weeks.”\nIn Indian markets, the sharp decline in IT stocks dragged the Nifty IT index down more than 7 per cent to an intraday low of 35,809.50 on Wednesday. China’s CSI Software Services Index fell 3 per cent, Hong Kong-listed Kingdee International Software Group tumbled more than 13 per cent, and in Japan, Recruit Holdings and Nomura Research dropped 9 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.",

The CCI’s decision comes as regulatory scrutiny intensifies on how airlines manage capacity and operational disruptions, particularly during peak travel periods, with potential repercussions for both travellers and industry competitors. \"By cancelling thousands of flights constituting a significant portion of the scheduled capacity, IndiGo effectively withheld its service from the market, creating an artificial scarcity, limiting consumer access to air travel during peak demand,\" the order read. In comparison, the Air India Group and Akasa Air held 29.6% and 5.2% of the market, respectively, in December, while SpiceJet and Alliance Air represented smaller shares. The commission’s focus on Section 4 of the Competition Act underscores the seriousness of the alleged abuse of dominance, particularly as the airline’s decisions affected such a large majority of travellers.",

In a statement, IndiGo said its widebody operations have been impacted by continuously changing airspace constraints due to geo-political circumstances, congestion at airports both in India and abroad. “These factors significantly increased flight and block times causing strain over the airline’s 787-9 schedule that is operated with six wide-body aircraft. With the objective of avoiding inconvenience to customers due to misconnections and cascading delays, IndiGo has decided to take some immediate measures to restore operational reliability in terms of on-time performance for its widebody operation,” the airline said. Other than cuts to European flights the airline has already cancelled flights to Central Asian destinations of Almaty, Baku, Tashkent and Tbilisi until February 28 “in view of developing situation around Iran”.",

Working across different regions in India and globally, he managed business areas touted as most critical in India’s banking landscape, such as corporate credit, international banking, treasury operations, equity portfolio management, retail banking and agriculture and rural banking. Before SBI MF, Tonse was heading the critical Chennai Circle of SBI as Chief General Manager, managing 15,000 employees and a network of 1,260 branches and offices of SBI situated in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. After a SBI-led consortium rescued YES Bank by infusing about Rs 10,000 crore in 2020, the lender under Kumar’s leadership took a conservative approach in growing YES Bank’s loan book. SBI was the largest investor in YES Bank, but with Japanese lender SMBC picking up 24 per cent stake in YES, it is no longer the case and it will be the prerogative of Tonse to coordinate and work with the largest investors in the bank, who may gradually become promoters of the lender.",

CCI also noted that by the cancellation of thousands of flights that constitute a significant portion of the scheduled capacity, IndiGo effectively withheld its service from the market, creating an artificial scarcity, limiting consumer access to air travel during peak demand. In response to CCI queries, IndiGo said issue raised in the complaint do not fall within the jurisdiction of the CCI and asked that no further action be taken in the matter. It further contended that any residual individual consumer grievances relating to service outcomes, such as flight cancellations or consequential pricing concerns, are appropriately redressed under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and do not give rise to a cause of action under Competition Law. In such a situation, the harm is no longer confined to this route versus that route; rather, the conduct constrains the overall ability of consumers to use domestic air travel as a mode of transport, regardless of which specific pair of cities they want to fly between.",

The BJP was reacting to comments made by DMK Agriculture Minister MRK Panneer Selvam at a party event in Chengalpattu, where he spoke about North Indians working in low-paying jobs. “At a party event in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu, DMK agriculture minister Shri MRK Panneer mocked North Indian migrants as “table cleaners and pani puri sellers.” In today’s India, people from every state work everywhere - North, South, and across the world. At a time when violence against innocent migrant workers in Tamil Nadu is rising, such statements are reckless and dangerous, branding an entire community as “low standard” and fuelling hate on the streets,” the post said. Even as attacks on North Indians are already rampant under the DMK regime, I strongly condemn the Minister of DMK, Mr. MRK Panneer ,for mocking them at a meeting held in Maduranthakam in Chengalpattu district by saying, “North Indians come to Tamil Nadu only to sell pani puri, work in construction, or wipe tables.” The DMK Minister must immediately seek a public apology from the people for his arrogant speech,” the post said.",

In a 16-page order, CCI said that by cancelling thousands of flights, which constituted a significant portion of the scheduled capacity, IndiGo effectively withheld its services from the market, creating an artificial scarcity, limiting consumer access to air travel during peak demand. \"IndiGo consistently accounts for approximately 60–61 per cent of total domestic ASKM (Available Seat Kilometres), which reflects not only passenger volumes but effective control over market capacity and supply-side conditions. On the basis of substantial and sustained market share, wide network reach with exclusive operations on a significant number of city-pair routes, comparatively larger fleet and strong financial performance, the watchdog said it was of prima facie view that IndiGo enjoys a position of dominance in the relevant market delineated supra. \"While DGCA discharges sector-specific regulatory functions, such as licensing, safety oversight and operational supervision, it does not undertake competition law analysis, including delineation of the relevant market, assessment of dominance and its alleged abuse, examination of coordinated conduct or evaluation of appreciable adverse effect on competition,\" the order said.",

If you are an investor, either in precious metals or in metals, be it the ferrous or the non-ferrous side, you need to have a little bit of elevated risk appetite, given the kind of rally that we've seen in precious metals over the last maybe about one-year plus, and metals in the last maybe about couple of weeks and months,\" Shah told Business Today on Thursday. Also, trade agreements with the UK, other nations, with the European Union, and of course, the contours of what has happened between India and the US trade deal will send a positive signal for this particular sector,\" he also said.

        "condensed_text": "At 9:49 am, Hindustan Zinc stock was trading 5.67 per cent lower at Rs 602.90 on the BSE, down from its previous close of Rs 639.15. The sharp pullback has dragged silver below key moving averages, pointing to short-term bearish pressure and an ongoing correction, even as the longer-term trend remains positive, said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money. “Strong buying interest is evident in the Rs 2,35,000–Rs 2,50,000 support band, aligned with prior swing lows and longer-term structural support. A sustained hold above this base, followed by a decisive recovery, could revive upward momentum toward Rs 3,00,000–Rs 3,25,000 in the coming periods,” Ponmudi said. On the technical front, data from Trendlyne suggests that Hindustan Zinc’s relative strength index (RSI) stands at 50.8, indicating that the stock is neither in the overbought nor oversold territory.",

Goldman Sachs, which has a neutral rating and a target price of ₹4,530, said the EBIT beat was driven by higher gross margins but cautioned that most operating-cost benefits were likely behind the company. Nuvama maintained a hold rating and a target price of ₹4,543, highlighting year-on-year growth of 16 per cent in revenue, 28 per cent in EBITDA and 19 per cent in adjusted profit after tax. The firm said revenue growth was broadly in line with its estimates, but EBITDA and adjusted profit after tax growth of 27 per cent and 40 per cent year-on-year were well ahead of expectations, raising questions about the quality of the beat. Citi pointed out that the EBITDA outperformance was led by a sharp expansion in gross margins, which it viewed as difficult to sustain because of a changing business mix, while the PAT boost was amplified by a surge in other income.",

Shares of EMS companies, Dixon Technologies Ltd., and Kaynes Technologies Ltd. fell as much as 4% on Thursday, February 5, after disappointing results and guidance from Smartphone processor manufacturer Qualcomm Inc. overnight.While shares of both companies are looking to recover from the lows of the day, they still are trading with losses of over 3%.Qualcomm said in its earnings call that while there is demand for high-end phones, some of its customers, particularly in China, are planning on making fewer handsets, as they are not able to procure enough memory chips and that prices are constantly on the rise.The shortfall in memory chips and the resultant rise in prices is something that has been highlighted by multiple brokerages, who had downgraded or cut price targets on Dixon Technologies in January.“While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high-tier smartphones,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the statement.Qualcomm's results and guidance were also below what the street had anticipated, leading to a 9% drop in its stock price during extended trading on Wednesday.In an interaction with CNBC-TV18 on Monday, Saurabh Gupta of Dixon Technologies highlighted that while it is unclear whether the Production-Linked Incentive Scheme for Mobiles will be extended, the company is investing in backward integration for cell modules and that financial year 2026-2027 will be a year of stabilization. The company is also confident of the Vivo approval coming and growth returning to other brands as well.Shares of Dixon Tech are down 2.8% on Thursday, snapping a three-day winning streak, while those of Kaynes are down to the lows of the day, currently trading 4% lower ahead of its December quarter results at ₹3,634.",

The company’s shares have declined more than 18% over the past year.These are the edited excerpts of the interview.Q: Explain to us first what led to the decline in revenue in Q4, and second, you're saying that the company is going through an unusually weak period, seasonality aside, explain to us what it means for Q1.A: Q4 was not what we expected. But just coming back to the one-offs that impacted your revenue in Q4, could you put a number to it?A: So, there were two, and, I'll say between the two, it impacted 60 to 70 bps of growth.Also Read | Mahindra Lifespace lines up ₹8,000 crore launches to power FY27 pre-salesQ: Now, the big worry is these agentic artificial intelligence  developments from many of these big tech companies are going to put pressure not just on software companies, package implementation companies, but even the IT outsourcing companies which help with the implementation of this packaged software, the application development and maintenance, which is a fair amount of IT services revenues, ADM, as we call it, and that will cause revenue deflation. Then the last step is generating the code, which is easier, but in aggregate, it is still a lot of work and a lot of spending, which went into the licence fee that will get translated to custom software development and agentic development.Also Read | Pidilite sees strong push from renovation and construction chemicalsQ: What's the extent of deflation seen in the legacy traditional business?A: Whenever a customer is going through a process of saying, okay, now let's do it in a new way, and often it's at the point of renewal, it could be 20–40% depending on the type of work.But not all of this is happening on day one or at a given point in time. Given this deflationary impact that we are seeing, do you think getting back to double digit is going to be hard for the next three years?A: So, we said, while this is the guidance that we called out essentially as a bottom, our core thesis of growing in the low teens and several accelerators to get us to mid to high teens remains completely intact.If you look at our history, every year that we've grown under 10%, the next two years have been outstanding growth.",

Margins may decline on a sequential basis, due to the steep discounts given by Chinese component manufacturers due to the decline in US tariffs.Net profit for the quarter is seen 62% higher from last year at ₹108 crore.A key factor to watch during the quarter will be the cash flow generation during the quarter, given that Kaynes had generated negative cash flow from operations in financial year 2025.JPMorgan expects the company's financial year 2026 revenue guidance to be cut down to ₹4,000 crore from ₹4,400 crore, while margin guidance may be maintained at 16%.Kaynes Tech shares are trading 3.8% lower on Thursday ahead of the results announcement at ₹3,633.

Rising awareness, improved affordability, and the ability to bundle diagnostic tests with consultations and wellness insights are helping Metropolis deepen customer engagement and improve realisations, supporting a steady expansion in these higher-margin segments.In October-December quarter , Metropolis Healthcare reported a revenue of ₹405.91 crore, profit of ₹41.39 crore and margins of 23%.Below are the edited excerpts of the conversation.Q: Your Truhealth and your specialty portfolio did record strong growth. How is the growth there?A: Let me talk about the smaller ones first, which is the Scientific Pathology, Dr. Ahuja's Pathology in Dehradun all of them are growing equal or better than the company growth in terms of revenue and their margins are better than the company levels of margins.Core Diagnostics, we have said in the first year our focus is basically the bigger integration that we have done. The next year could be a year of accelerating revenues as well as bringing margins above a two-digit number.Q: Are you in a position to take price hikes based on what you are seeing in your competitive environment, and if so, to the tune of how much and by when?A: Every year, we do a price increase in the month of January, but we haven't done this year the price increase because of the GST considerations, etc. Hence, we wanted to pass on the benefit to the consumer and we did not do a price increase this year.We believe that the market is conducive for price increase, and then can take a price hike, but we have not set any timelines for price increase, maybe at the appropriate time, we will look at the opportunity to take the price increase.Follow our live blog for more stock market updates",

Copper prices joined a broader rout across asset classes, including precious metals, with benchmark three-month copper on the LME dropping another 1% to $12,925 a ton amid concerns over rising supplies from China. A 12,750-tonne inflow into LME’s Asian warehouses in Taiwan and South Korea brought on-warrant copper stocks registered with the exchange to 155,725 tonnes, the highest level since March. At the same time, Beijing’s Nonferrous Metals Industry Association has forecast that the country’s refined copper output is likely to rise by about 5% this year, following a 10% surge last year, according to media reports. Elsewhere, markets are also focusing on the US plan for strategic stockpiling of critical minerals to counter China’s dominance, with the latest step announced on Wednesday to marshal allies into a preferential trade bloc and propose coordinated price floors.",

        "condensed_text": "Jan Suraaj, the political outfit launched by election strategist Prashant Kishor and touted as a disruptive force ahead of the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections, has knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court, challenging the outcome of the polls on the grounds of alleged corrupt practices by the ruling party.As per a report by Live Law, the party has filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, challenging the Bihar Assembly elections, 2025, alleging illegal practices and seeking fresh polls. Despite contesting 238 seats, Jan Suraaj failed to win a single seat in the election.At the heart of the challenge is the Bihar government’s decision to add fresh beneficiaries under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana and transfer ₹10,000 directly to women voters while the Model Code of Conduct was allegedly in force. The petition claims that direct benefit transfers were made to around 25–35 lakh women voters during the election period.A bench comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi is scheduled to hear the matter tomorrow.The petition seeks a declaration that the addition of beneficiaries and the payments made during the subsistence of the Model Code of Conduct were illegal and violative of Articles 14, 21, 112, 202 and 324 of the Constitution. It also urges the Election Commission of India to initiate action under Article 324 of the Constitution and Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, which deals with corrupt practices.Jan Suraaj has further challenged the deployment of nearly 1.8 lakh women associated with the JEEVIKA self-help group at polling booths during both phases of voting, arguing that the move was illegal and compromised the fairness of the electoral process.Alongside seeking fresh Assembly elections in Bihar on account of the alleged corrupt practices, the petition asks the Election Commission to implement the Supreme Court’s directions in S. Subramaniam Balaji v. State of Tamil Nadu  9 SCC 659. It has urged the Election Commission to prescribe a minimum implementation period—preferably six months—for schemes with electoral impact before the announcement of an election schedule.The legal challenge comes against the backdrop of Jan Suraaj’s electoral underperformance in a contest where it was widely discussed as a potential third force but failed to make a mark at the ballot box.",

Revenue from Voltas’ business group that sells room ACs and\naccounts ​for two-thirds of overall ⁠revenue slumped 25 per cent in\nApril-June 2025 due to early monsoon showers and milder summer\ntemperatures. ACs are ‍likely to get more expensive this year despite\nSeptember's consumption tax cuts, as Voltas has raised prices\nafter new ‍energy-efficiency norms took effect, and as soaring\ncopper and silver prices lift input costs. US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with\nIndia on Monday to cut tariffs to 18 per cent from 50 per cent in exchange for\nNew Delhi halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade\nbarriers, including on US ⁠industrial goods.",

        "condensed_text": "While global prices have softened, domestic sentiment is improving as output may fall short of earlier estimates due to the early end of the crushing season in Maharashtra and Karnataka.However, Tarun Sawhney, Vice Chairman and Managing Director at Triveni Engineering &amp; Industries says the improvement in prices is still insufficient. “With rising input costs, especially higher sugarcane prices, there is now an urgent need for better sugar pricing going forward,” he said.In October-December quarter , Triveni Engineering reported revenue of ₹478 crore, with margins at 11.8% and net profit at ₹77.8 crore.The distillery business continued to be the standout performer, supported by full utilisation of all five distillery units. Lower maize prices boosted margins during the year, but this benefit may reduce going forward as maize is likely to lose priority under the next ethanol procurement cycle.Management expects ethanol volumes to remain healthy, though margins could soften slightly as production shifts more towards Food Corporation of India  rice-based ethanol.Sawhney acknowledged this trend, saying, “As far as margins are concerned, we have seen the best, and the margins will be ever so slightly downwards.”Sahani addressed the recent ₹30 per quintal hike in cane prices in Uttar Pradesh. He remains optimistic about the upcoming plantation season, contingent on a good monsoon.Regarding the company's other ventures, the power transmission business saw a 9% rise in revenue, though operating income declined due to challenging global trends. Sahani expressed confidence, citing a resilient January and the potential for an uptick in orders from new Free Trade Agreements  with Europe and the United States.The defence business, though a startup, is growing and recently won a large gearing tender, positioning it to benefit from India's domestic manufacturing push.Triveni Engineering’s current market capitalisation is ₹8,239.32 crore.",

        "condensed_text": "Gurugram-based solar panel manufacturer, Saatvik Green Energy remains confident about sustaining its strong growth momentum, supported by rising demand for solar equipment, capacity expansion, and a broader product portfolio.Prashant Mathur, CEO of Saatvik Green Energy said, “We have consistently been growing. We have expanded our portfolio, not only in model manufacturing, but inverter, pumps, EPC and more.”In October-December quarter , Saatvik Green Energy reported a revenue of ₹1,257 crore, profit after tax of ₹98 crore and margins at 12.15%.Capacity expansion is a key driver of the company’s forward outlook. Saatvik’s Odisha project is progressing as planned, which will almost double its manufacturing capacity from 4.8 gigawatts to 8.8 gigawatts.Module manufacturing from the new facility is expected to begin in the first quarter of the next financial year. Cell manufacturing is scheduled to start in the second half of the year and is expected to improve profitability, even if its revenue contribution is initially limited.On margins, Mathur said that for a module manufacturer, EBITDA margins of around 13% and PAT margins of about 9–10% are considered healthy, and the company has consistently delivered within this range. He added that the company prefers to offer conservative guidance and outperform it, noting that EBITDA margins of close to 16% were delivered in the first nine months.Looking ahead, management expects the growth momentum to continue, supported by a strong order pipeline and seasonally strong final quarter.Recently listed Saatvik Green Energy has a current market capitalisation of ₹5,271.04 crore.",

The hospital chain’s gross revenue grew 10 percent YoY to Rs.2,608 crore, supported by a 7 percent increase in occupied bed days (OBDs) and strong international patient demand. Operating margin slipped to 26.1 percent, down from 27.3 percent a year earlier, the company attributed the margin compression to several factors including discontinuation of high‑value patented chemotherapy drugs for institutional patients after restrictive pricing guidelines from CGHS, pre‑commissioning expenses as new brownfield capacity came online in Mohali, Nanavati Max and Max Smart and GST rate change. The ARPOB (average revenue per occupied bed) rose to Rs.77,900 from Rs.75,900 a year earlier, while EBITDA per bed declined to Rs.71.3 lakh from Rs.73 lakh because of the cost overhang. 53 beds were commissioned at MSSH Mohali, delivering an EBITDA margin of 39 percent; 63 beds were added at Nanavati Max with a 31 percent margin; and a 400‑bed tower at Max Smart is expected to go live by February.",

At the current run rate, this is an eight-to-nine-month order book, and in our industry, eight to nine months is a good order book,” he said.Also Read: Interarch Building Products eyes 20% revenue growth in FY26 on strong order bookTo support future growth, Interarch is expanding manufacturing capacity through two new plants. “By the end of June or July, we should be doing trial production at both the facilities, and once fully ramped up, the two plants together will add about 60,000 tonne to our existing two lakh tonne of capacity,” he said.Garg also highlighted data centres as an important growth driver for the company’s institutional and infrastructure segment.",

        "condensed_text": "Berger Paints India Ltd reported a mixed performance for the December quarter, with profitability under pressure despite healthy volume growth and improving demand conditions.Net profit declined 8.1% YoY to ₹271.1 crore, while revenue was largely flat at ₹2,984 crore, up a marginal 0.3% YoY. EBITDA stood at ₹471 crore, nearly unchanged from last year, with margins at 15.78%, broadly in line with guidance.Shares of the company closed 1.3% lower at ₹473.85 on the NSE post the results.Volumes strong, margins resilientStandalone volumes grew a robust 8.5% during the quarter, supported by a gradual recovery in demand after a weak October impacted by extended monsoons and a shortened festive season. Gross margins touched their highest level in the past 15 quarters, aided by input cost moderation.However, EBITDA margin remained under pressure due to negative operating leverage and sustained investments in brand building, according to management.Segmental trends and outlookKey focus segments — waterproofing, construction chemicals and wood coatings — continued to deliver healthy growth. Automotive coatings registered mid-single-digit growth, while protective and general industrial coatings also saw positive momentum.Commenting on the outlook, Abhijit Roy, Managing Director &amp; CEO, said demand indicators have been improving sequentially, with month-on-month upticks across segments. He added that these trends, along with margin stability within guidance, are expected to coalesce into better performance in the coming months, though near-term risks from forex volatility and geopolitical uncertainty remain.Also Read: Max Healthcare Q3 Results: Revenue up 9% YoY; occupancy dips, ARPOB rises 3%The company reaffirmed its focus on network expansion, innovation and brand building, while also highlighting strong ESG performance, with Berger Paints scoring 64 on NSE’s ESG parameters, ahead of industry peers.",

The home minister is scheduled to visit Jammu and Kashmir in the coming days, and I assure the House, and especially the MLA from Bandipora, that this issue will certainly be discussed with him,\" the chief minister, who also holds the tourism portfolio, said.Nearly 50 tourist destinations were shut down by the LG administration after terrorists shot dead 26 tourists at Baisaran in the Pahalgam area on April 22 last year.However, over a dozen destinations reopened in September, but many continue to remain closed.Earlier replying to the question raised by National Conference MLA Ali Mohd Sagar, Abdullah said since the rules governing the of registration or renewal of all tourism units have been framed in 1978 as such, the tourism department is in the process of revising the Jammu and Kashmir Tourist Trade Rules with a view to further simplify, rationalise and streamline the registration and renewal framework for all tourism units. Such activities also contribute meaningfully to skill entrepreneurship development, sustainable employment generation among the youth,\" the chief minister said.Abdullah said the department outsources various assets like the cafeteria, huts, parking areas and entry tickets, which provide direct and indirect employment to youth regularly.Also Read: Kerala Assembly urges Centre to withdraw VB-G RAM G Act, restore MGNREGAFurther, he said, the government has formally notified simplified guidelines for the registration of homestays to encourage community participation and promote inclusive and balanced tourism development, particularly in border and rural areas.He added that the registration and renewal of guest houses, hotels, homestays, travel agencies, and other tourism units are being carried out online. Upon fulfilment of all requisite formalities as per the prescribed checklist, the applicant is assured of registration/renewal within a stipulated time frame of 30 days through the online system,” he said.Responding to various repeated supplementaries raised by the members, the chief minister said, ”We ourselves acknowledge within the department that the registration process is cumbersome and needs to be simplified.” ”I am personally ashamed to admit that since 1978, we never even thought of reviewing these rules and procedures. \"The reality, and we must accept this, is that in many cases when these processes or NOCs are deliberately delayed, the underlying intention is to extract bribes, so that once money is paid under the table, the file starts moving,\" he added.Responding to another question from MLA Banihal Sajad Shaheen, he said the government is examining a proposal to notify a new tourism destination in J-K, including several locations in Ramban district like Godagali, Nathatop, Daggan ToP, Neel Top, Mahoo, Sarvadhar , Sargali Pogal, Chanderkote and Bhatni.For the financial year 2025-26, he said ₹117.27 lakhs have been allocated under the Capex Budget for the development of tourism infrastructure in Banihal-Gool Constituency.Also Read: Ghaziabad triple suicide: Father of 3 girls who jumped to death has ₹2 crore debt, sold their phones",

        "condensed_text": "Sleeper hit Dhurandhar has emerged as a major growth driver for PVR INOX, helping India’s largest multiplex chain clock its highest quarterly footfalls and best nine-month performance since the pandemic, even as several big-ticket releases failed to meet expectations earlier in the festive season.The film accounted for nearly 28–29% of PVR INOX’s total box office collections in the December quarter, according to Chief Financial Officer Gaurav Sharma, underscoring how a single breakout title can materially lift theatrical performance.“Dhurandhar came on December 5 and still did only 24 days of business in the quarter, but it ended up contributing close to 30% of our box office,” Sharma said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.Content-led recovery gains momentumManaging Director Ajay Bijli said the strong performance highlights a structural shift underway in the Indian exhibition industry, where content quality, rather than star power alone, is driving footfalls.“The Indian movie market today is like the IPL—you don’t know which player will win the match,” Bijli said. However, the late-quarter surge driven by Dhurandhar helped the company end the period on a strong footing.“We’ve had the highest footfalls in the last quarter, and even the first nine months have been the best post-pandemic,” Bijli said.New stars, strong turnoutImportantly, Bijli noted that the recovery is not being driven by one film alone. Several movies featuring relatively new actors, and without blockbuster credentials at release, also delivered solid theatrical numbers.“That only goes to show that if content connects with consumers, there is no end to how well a movie can perform,” he said.The trend points to a broad-based revival in cinema-going, at a time when concerns around OTT platforms and shortened theatrical windows had raised questions over the long-term sustainability of the exhibition business.OTT release did not dent theatrical runAddressing concerns around Dhurandhar’s relatively quick debut on Netflix, Bijli said the eight-week theatrical-to-OTT window has now become an industry norm and does not cannibalise cinema revenues.“It was tapering off by the seventh week, which is actually a lot for an Indian film that released across so many screens,” he said. “The OTT window allows all stakeholders to coexist.”Also Read | Ranveer Singh’s Dhurandhar beats Dangal, 3 Idiots and K3G with 4 crore ticket salesQ4 set to remain strongLooking ahead, PVR INOX expects momentum to continue into the March quarter, with Dhurandhar 2 slated for release on March 19 and other big-ticket films such as Toxic also hitting screens.“Earlier, February was considered a weak period. That trend is clearly changing, with large films now releasing even in Q4,” Bijli said.The company expects the evolving release calendar, coupled with improving content depth, to support footfalls and revenues in the coming quarters.Watch accompanying video for entire conversation.",

On the upside, as mentioned earlier, the index would desperately need a decisive breach above the 60,500 level to trigger a fresh upward move in the coming days.”\nParekh stated that immediate support for the Nifty 50 index is located at 25,500, while the resistance level is at 25,800. 1] LIC: Buy at ₹ 840, Target ₹ 880, Stop Loss ₹ 820;\n2] GMR Power: Buy at ₹ 105, Target ₹ 115, Stop Loss ₹ 102; and\n3] PNB Housing Finance: Buy at ₹ 840, Target ₹ 885, Stop Loss ₹ 825.

Also Read | Defence stocks face test of nerves as 22% capex lift in Union Budget meets lofty valuations Nifty target at 29,000 by December 2026 On the broader market outlook following the US-India trade deal announcement, Shah struck an optimistic tone. \"We see scope for this equation to turn favourable in 2HCY26 with potential Fed cuts, which typically lead to emerging market inflows, improving earnings momentum in 2HCY26, our expectations of a continued reform push by the government, potential upsides to budgetary estimates providing room for fiscal stimulus in 2HCY26 and a decision on the quantum of Pay Commission hikes,\" he said. \"We believe Nifty could see earnings accelerate to 13.5% in FY27, supported by a pick-up in loan growth for financials, improving discretionary demand aided by GST cuts, telecom tariff hikes, stronger realisations for non-ferrous metals and a favourable base for IT and staples. We would continue to maintain a selective stance on the sector and prefer only those companies where visibility of acceleration in growth in FY27 is high, backed by their ability to participate in AI services spends and where there is a proactive and concerted push towards an AI-led operating model.\"",

The prepaid cards enable organisations to pre-define spending limits and rules based on parameters such as employee role, project, geography, and expense category.Transactions made using the cards are automatically recorded in the ProXpense platform, where they are categorized and checked against company policies before being routed for approval. Finance teams can also modify or block card usage in real time if required.The platform provides data on budget utilisation, spending trends, and policy compliance, along with alerts for duplicate or potentially irregular transactions. The companies said this could help organisations improve oversight of corporate spending.Pine Labs is providing the card issuing and processing infrastructure for the program, including compliance and deployment support, while ProXpense is responsible for the expense automation and analytics layer.The cards are targeted at mid-to-large enterprises, frequent business travelers, field operations teams, and project-based organizations. Key use cases include travel expenses, client meetings, events, subscriptions, and branch-level operational spending, where cash usage and delayed reporting are still common in many firms.The launch comes at a time when more companies are seeking tighter control over expenses, faster reconciliation processes, and better integration between payment systems and enterprise finance tools.",

        "condensed_text": "Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) on Thursday said ICICI Bank Ltd was its top pick in the banking sector, saying the board’s recommendation to extend Sandeep Bakhshi’s tenure as Magaging Director and chief executive officer by two years had removed a key overhang and reinforced leadership stability. MOFSL said ICICI Bank shares had delivered a modest 6 per cent return in FY26 so far, compared with an average 21 per cent return over FY23, FY24 and FY25. “The bank’s strong focus on core PPoP growth while fostering a cohesive organisational culture underpins its position as a resilient and successful institution,” MOFSL said. “The bank remains firmly on track to deliver RoA of 2.2 per cent in FY26E, despite one-off provisions in Q3, and RoE of 16 per cent over FY26-27. With the extension of Bakhshi’s term, the brokerage said the bank was well positioned to continue delivering best-in-class growth and profitability and remained one of the most dependable large-bank stories in the sector.",

Breaking down the figures, 137 of Air India’s 166 aircraft had repetitive defects, while 54 of 101 planes from Air India Express were flagged. An Air India spokesperson attributed the higher number of flagged aircraft to rigorous inspection protocols, stating that checks were conducted \"out of an abundance of caution\". The executive told news agency PTI that most issues related to lower-priority equipment, such as seats, tray tables, and screens, which fall under category D and are not related to aircraft safety. The regulator carried out 3,890 surveillance inspections, 56 regulatory audits, 84 surveillance of foreign aircraft (SOFA) checks, and 492 ramp inspections as part of scheduled monitoring activities.",

In the post, they highlighted that the train was not overcrowded and described the system as “clean, modern, and good value.”\nI've been on the #Kolkata metro before, but was impressed with how it wasn't overcrowded, along with being clean, modern, and good value 👏🇮🇳🚇 #India #NonstopEurotrip pic.twitter.com/MAGKN9g8y9\n“I've been on the #Kolkata Metro before, but was impressed with how it wasn't overcrowded, along with being clean, modern, and good value,” the traveller wrote, tagging #India and #NonstopEurotrip. One of the most significant recent milestones has been the full operationalisation of the East-West Metro corridor, connecting Salt Lake Sector V with Howrah Maidan, including an under-river tunnel beneath the Hooghly. Ridership numbers underline the metro’s importance, with the network carrying over 8 lakh passengers on peak days, particularly during festivals and high-traffic periods. While commuters acknowledge crowding during rush hours, many online agreed that the Kolkata Metro remains affordable, reliable and relatively well maintained—qualities that, they say, deserve far more recognition than the system often receives.",

        "headline": "Indian stocks enjoy a rare combination, makes a case for re-rating: Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai",
        "condensed_text": "Indian stocks, Desai argues in a strategy report, now offer an unusual mix of “inexpensive relative valuations, poor trailing performance, strong policy stimulus and a consequent growth upcycle, an undervalued currency, weak foreign positioning and potentially a new buyback cycle.” The 12-month trailing performance is “the worst in history” even as relative valuations are “approaching previous troughs”, with foreign portfolio investor (FPI) positioning having weakened steadily over the past four years. The report cites the combination of rate cuts, bank deregulation, liquidity infusion, continued capex, tax reductions and a “relatively stimulating budget” as evidence that “India’s hawkish macro set-up post-Covid is now unwinding.” Trade deals and a thaw in relations with China are seen as additional tailwinds to growth and risk appetite. Desai highlights that “the falling intensity of oil in GDP and rising share of exports in GDP, especially services, and fiscal consolidation imply a lower saving imbalance,” which in turn should allow “structurally lower real rates.” At the same time, lower inflation volatility, driven by supply-side reforms and flexible inflation targeting, should mean “volatility in interest rates and growth rates is likely falling in coming years.” Morgan Stanley’s base case sets a December 2026 Sensex target of 95,000, implying upside of 13% and a trailing P/E of 23.5 times, above the 25-year average of 22 times, to reflect “greater confidence in the medium-term growth cycle in India, India’s lower beta, a higher terminal growth rate and a predictable policy environment.” The base case rests on continued gains in macro stability through fiscal consolidation, increased private investment and a sustained positive gap between real growth and real rates, alongside “robust domestic growth, steady global growth and benign oil prices.” The bull case, with a 30% probability, pegs the Sensex at 107,000 by December 2026, assuming oil prices “persistently below US$60 per barrel”, successful reflation that lifts growth estimates, and a curtailment of the global trade war, with Sensex earnings compounding at 19% annually over FY25–28. The bear case, assigned a 20% probability, takes the Sensex down to 76,000 if oil spikes above US$90 per barrel, the RBI is forced to tighten, global growth slows materially and the US slips into recession, with earnings growth moderating to 15% and equity multiples de-rating to reflect a weaker macro environment. The firm’s proprietary leading earnings indicator “is suggesting improving earnings growth”, while its composite valuation indicator, which blends 11 absolute and relative metrics, points to “equity returns of around 16% in the next 12 months.” Sensex earnings in the base case are projected to compound at 17% annually through FY28, with the top-down framework for the broader market showing EPS growth of 22% in FY26, 20% in FY27 and 17% in FY28.",

        "condensed_text": "SEBI has decided that calendar spread margin benefits will not be available on the expiry day for single-stock derivative contracts expiring on that day, aligning the rule with index derivatives. In its circular, SEBI stated, “On the basis of references received from trading members regarding possible risks emanating from calendar spread benefits on the expiry day for single stocks, and subsequent deliberations with the Secondary Market Advisory Committee (SMAC) of SEBI, it has been decided that the benefit of offsetting positions across different expiries shall not be available on the day of expiry for contracts expiring on that day for single-stock derivatives.” However, SEBI clarified that existing margin calculations for calendar spread positions will remain unchanged for positions involving expiries other than the contracts expiring on a given day. If monthly expiries fall on the 29th (current month), 30th (next month), and 31st (far month), calendar spread positions involving contracts expiring on the 29th and 30th, or the 29th and 31st, will not be eligible for calendar spread treatment on the 29th (current month expiry). In the absence of such measures, SEBI noted that there is a risk of a sudden increase in margins on the day following the expiry of one leg of a calendar spread position, with limited recourse available to trading members in cases of margin shortfall or significant adverse price movement in the open leg. SEBI said the changes will align the calendar spread treatment for single-stock derivatives with that of index derivatives and provide sufficient time to end clients and trading members to bring in additional margin on the expiry day or to roll over or close calendar spread positions.",

        "condensed_text": "International brokerage Jefferies has highlighted mounting pressures at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) reported a weak December quarter, with EBITDA plunging 91% YoY to about Rs 940 crore, though the performance was better than the brokerage’s estimates. While Q4 is expected to be better as production is likely to normalise in the March quarter as the cyberattack impact fades, Jefferies believes JLR continues to face several structural challenges that could weigh on profitability and growth. Jefferies noted that JLR’s break-even level has risen, with the business delivering an average EBITDA margin of just 3.6% in 9MFY26 on average quarterly volumes of 71,000 units, compared with over 9.6% margins in Q2 and Q3 FY22 at around 67,000 units per quarter. Jefferies expects Tata’s PV volumes to rise 18% YoY in FY26 and grow at an 11% CAGR over FY26 to FY28, with EBITDA margins improving toward 7.5 to 8.0% by FY27 to FY28. It expects FY27 and FY28 to be better than FY26 but estimates FY28 EPS to remain 26% below FY25 levels, with FY27 and FY28 EPS still 23 to 33% below Street expectations.",

AI is surprising us with the magnitude of impact it is having latest… in areas that we had earlier probably not even anticipated.”Even if margins are protected, Shah warned, “if revenues are not growing or see erosion, that would obviously lead to an impact on EPS.”From an investor’s point of view, the bigger near-term risk is valuation. “When there is such a fast-moving technology having such a massive impact, many will prefer to stay on the sidelines and sort of wait it out — and that means there is definitely a risk for further multiple contraction,” Shah said.Also Read: Is it time to buy IT stocks yet? “By the time we finish a project, we might realise we could have done this differently based on the availability of some new AI tool.”Also Read: Devina Mehra on IT stocks: No reason to panic sell or bottom-fish right nowReflecting this caution, Shah said his firm is re-evaluating its IT holdings and confirmed that the direction is towards selling.

The RBI’s decision to keep the repo rate unchanged is, however, expected to help stabilise interest rates and support housing market momentum, according to developers and real estate sector experts. Sahil Agrawal, Chief Executive Officer of Nimbus Group, said the move to hold the repo rate at 5.25 percent supports a mature housing cycle. The RBI’s six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on February 6 unanimously voted to keep the repo rate unchanged at 5.25 percent, while retaining a neutral policy stance. The RBI kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged as inflation remained at manageable levels and growth concerns eased amid increased government spending and lower tariff pressures following a trade deal with the United States.",

However, the Budget also clarified that the effective duty rate will continue at 25% through a notification, meaning there is no immediate increase in tax outgo for cigarette companies.

        "condensed_text": "Ahmedabad-based manufacturer of building materials Astral Limited remains optimistic about the fourth quarter, traditionally the strongest period for the building materials industry, driven by seasonal demand and operating leverage benefits.With Astral holding low-cost inventory and benefiting from recent price increases, margins are expected to improve sequentially.Strong restocking activity and a visible uptick in demand since December have further strengthened confidence of surpassing third-quarter volume levels, even in a rising price environment.Hiranand Savlani, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer of Astral Limited, said the company is likely to come close to achieving double-digit topline growth for the full year, even though revenue growth stands at around 8% for the first nine months.Beyond plumbing, Astral continues to invest in scaling up its adhesives, paints, and bathware businesses, which are steadily gaining traction despite being at a relatively early stage.While margins in these segments may remain modest in the near term due to expansion-led costs, the company expects strong topline growth and improved profitability over the medium term as scale benefits kick in.In October-December quarter , Astral reported revenue of ₹1,542 crore, net profit of ₹108 crore, and margin of 15.39%. What is the situation that you are seeing on the ground currently and do you believe that, based on what you have witnessed so far does that improve in the fourth quarter, going into the final quarter of the year?A: If you see industry dynamics, the industry is not growing that high because Astral did a lot of decentralisation in the recent time and because of that, our volumes were excellent. We are expecting the volume will further inch up, because the industry was passing through a very tough time.Last three years, if you see the polymer prices were going down, and this is the first quarter where we are seeing that, at least now the bottom out is being taken place, and from here on, the prices have started going up. We are expecting better volume than what was there in Q3.Q: Do you think you will exceed your volume growth despite higher prices, and if you could break your Q4 targets, volume and value-wise?A: Normally, whenever the price rise is there, a lot of restocking take place in the street. Since you mentioned you are on fairly decent, low priced inventory right now, when do you expect the realisations to recover?A: Q4 onward you will see the realisation will start picking up.Q: From a medium- to long-term standpoint, what kind of revenue mix are you expecting coming in from the PVC plumbing business?",

        "condensed_text": "The Indian stock market turned into the green in Friday’s session on February 6 after a range-bound trade, supported by gains in FMCG and select private banking stocks, which helped offset losses in IT, pharma and auto shares. At its sixth and final bi-monthly monetary policy review for the current financial year, the central bank decided to retain the repo rate at 5.25% and maintained a neutral stance. In terms of sector-wise performance, Nifty FMCG led the gainers with a 2.27% surge, while Nifty Consumer Durables, Nifty Oil & Gas, and Nifty Realty also ended higher, posting gains of up to 1%. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, said, \"Domestic equity markets traded largely subdued through most of the session before staging a late recovery, supported by selective buying in FMCG and private banking stocks. However, markets had anticipated a mildly dovish undertone, which failed to materialise as the RBI retained its neutral stance, resulting in an uptick in India’s 10-year bond yields,\" he further added.",

From launches and sustenance, generally, for the last few quarters, a rule of thumb has been between one-third of our volume to maybe sometimes half of the sales is sustenance, and it's largely emanating because we have a very different structure in Godrej Properties, where we have a dedicated sustenance sales engine, which delivers consistent sales performance, whereas, when we get launches, the launch percentage tends to become slightly better.Q: In that case, how does the launch pipeline look, and how will you fund the upcoming launches?A: Because of the fantastic effort by our business development team, over the last three odd years, we have added about ₹1 lakh crore-plus inventory from 2022-23 . So, a lot of action is packed up, some of which we will see action in this quarter itself, and some of which we will see action continue next financial year, 2026-27 .I'll maybe mention some of the top-of-mind names that come to my mind, which are in this quarter, and their phase activation will continue next year as well, and some launches that can happen next year as well.Also Read: Raymond Realty sees stronger FY26 on back of premium and ultra-luxury launchesSo maybe a bit of a gist — in the north, we will see something very exciting in this quarter itself, which is a project by the name Godrej Arden. We bought recently in Hosur Road last quarter, a 30-acre parcel in a micro market, and this is like a ₹3,500 crore potential booking value that should hit the market next financial year.And then we bought something in Hyderabad recently in an auction, a prime piece of land of five acres, with a potential booking value of ₹4,500 crore, which should hit the market next financial year.In Mumbai, we have a series of launches. So, any developer who was looking at that as the core demand bucket would, of course, see some amount of hit, because that is an easy-come-easy-go market, I would say.But anything which is more end-user driven, which is in the right micro markets of Gurugram, is doing pretty well for us and for our competition and peer group as well.",

Operating EBITDA grew 4% year-on-year to ₹648 crore, while operating margin declined to 26.1% from 27.3% a year earlier and 26.9% in the previous quarter. The company said margins were impacted by the discontinuation of patented chemotherapy drugs for institutional patients, pre-commissioning expenses related to brownfield bed additions and a change in GST rates. Overall EBITDA per bed stood at ₹71.3 lakh, compared with ₹73.0 lakh in Q3 FY25 and ₹73.4 lakh in Q2 FY26. “As per the new CGHS Memorandum of Agreement (MoA), patients are encouraged to procure oncology drugs directly from CGHS outlets and have them administered at empanelled hospitals.",

        "condensed_text": "India’s largest stock exchange, the National Stock Exchange (NSE), reported a sharp 37% year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,408 crore for the third quarter , even as it marked an important regulatory milestone with the receipt of SEBI’s no-objection certificate (NOC) for its long-awaited initial public offering (IPO). Revenue from data feed and terminal services jumped 17% year-on-year to ₹121 crore, while listing services revenue rose 11% to ₹111 crore, highlighting the growing contribution of non-transaction income. Last Friday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) granted a formal no-objection certificate to NSE to proceed with its IPO, bringing an end to prolonged delays stemming from governance issues and the co-location controversy. A key breakthrough came last month when SEBI Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the regulator had granted in-principle approval to NSE’s settlement application in the co-location case, a move widely seen as clearing the path for the IPO. NSE Managing Director and CEO Ashish Kumar Chauhan had earlier described the in-principle approval as a positive signal, noting that once the NOC was received, the exchange would begin preparations for filing the DRHP.",

The Policybazaar parent is likely to return with a proposal to raise as much as $1 billion through a qualified institutional placement once the investor outreach is concluded and market conditions stabilise, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The company has appointed Kotak Mahindra Capital Co., IIFL Capital Services Ltd., and local units of HSBC Holdings Plc and Citigroup Inc. as advisers for the transaction, the people said. In an exchange filing late evening on Friday, the company said that reports on reviving fundraise plan are “factually untrue” and “the management or the board are not considering the qualified institutional placement”. “There have been concerns around capital allocation following the earlier hospital venture, and now with expansion into international markets,” Suresh Ganapathy, managing director and head of financial services research at Macquarie Capital, wrote in a note early this week.",

        "condensed_text": "Birla acquired a total of 4.09 crore Vodafone Idea shares, representing 0.03% of the company’s outstanding equity, between January 30 and February 1 via open market. Brokerage house Emkay Global Financial Services has upgraded its rating on Vodafone Idea shares to ‘Add’ from ‘Sell’, and has doubled its target price for the telco, considering the improved outlook for the company. The relief reduces the net present value (NPV) of the burden by 60–80%, easing immediate survival pressure, along with the possibility of further reduction on reassessment of AGR dues. This will enable VI to access bank funding for 4G/5G expansion, helping the company arrest subscriber churn and market-share loss,” said Pranav Kshatriya, Senior Research Analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.\nWith the government freezing AGR dues , the NPV of the AGR dues drops to ₹ 50,000 crore, versus ₹ 87,000 crore earlier, with a further scope for reduction in liabilities in case of a favorable outcome of recalculation and reconciliation, he noted. While the long-term sustainability of the company is no more a concern, Emkay believes that Vodafone Idea will have to execute well to gain subscriber market share and migrate the subscriber base from 2G to 4G/5G.",

Jigar S.

Investors may consider accumulating the stock in the ₹ 1,390–1,430 range, with an upside target of ₹ 1,530 and a stop loss placed at ₹ 1,360 on a closing basis to manage risk effectively,\" said Patel.",

Jefferies and Motilal Oswal led the bullish chorus with Rs 1,300 price targets, citing robust return on equity prospects and a ₹354-per-share valuation for subsidiaries as the state-owned lender reported a third-quarter net profit of ₹21,030 crore, an 18% beat on estimates driven by higher fee income and lower-than-expected provisions. \"SBI stays among our top-picks in the sector with Buy rating & PT of Rs1,300 (earlier Rs1,190), valuing bank at 1.5x Mar-28E adj P/B,\" Jefferies said, raising earnings estimates by 2-4% for fiscal 2027-28 and projecting 12% compound annual growth in core profit over fiscal 2026-28. Motilal Oswal matched the ₹1,300 target, valuing the lender at 1.4 times fiscal 2028 adjusted book value plus ₹354 for subsidiaries, while raising earnings estimates by 3% and 4.3% for fiscal 2027-28. Nomura raised its target price to ₹1,235 from ₹1,100, valuing the core bank at 1.4 times December 2027 book value per share, up from 1.3 times previously, with subsidiaries contributing ₹250 per share.",

        "condensed_text": "HDFC Bank has cut its Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rates  by 5 basis points  on select loan tenures, a move that could ease borrowing costs for customers whose loans are linked to this benchmark. The revised rates took effect from February 7, the bank said in its latest rate update.MCLR serves as the internal benchmark for pricing a range of floating-rate loans, including some home, personal, and business loans. A basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point, making this a marginal but meaningful adjustment for eligible borrowers.The reduction comes a day after the Reserve Bank of India kept the policy repo rate unchanged, indicating that banks continue to recalibrate lending rates based on funding costs rather than central bank cues alone.HDFC Bank lowered rates only for specific maturities, while keeping others steady. The three-year MCLR saw a 5-bps revision, with shorter tenures such as overnight and one-month rates left unchanged.Revised HDFC Bank MCLRLoan TenureRevised MCLR Overnight8.25%One Month8.25%Three Months8.30%Six Months8.40%One Year8.40%Two Years8.50%Three Years8.60%What this means for borrowersCustomers with loans tied to HDFC Bank’s MCLR framework may see slight changes in interest costs, depending on their loan reset cycle and tenure. While the impact on monthly EMIs may be modest, the move signals the bank’s gradual adjustment to evolving funding conditions.Broader trendPrivate and public sector banks have periodically tweaked benchmark lending rates in recent months, balancing deposit costs, liquidity conditions, and policy signals from the RBI.",

The top broking firms have collectively added nearly a crore new active investors in 2024, and the losses in 2025 constitute a small percentage of their overall user base. The stricter regulatory measures include tighter margin requirements, reduced weekly expiries, higher capital thresholds, and increased taxation, making derivatives trading significantly less attractive to retail investors. According to a broker, some of the investor growth has been driven by Gold ETF investors over the last three months as the yellow metal has touched historic highs, though the gold price has been highly volatile since 2026.",

For Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd, formerly SKS Finance, not having secured a small finance bank licence, inking a deal with IndusInd Bank was the next logical next move. For IndusInd Bank, the acquisition solved many problems in one go — an entry into the mass market lending business, a never seen before bump up in net interest margin and a quick boost to return ratios. Shrinking cycles\nWhen asked how he would manage the business given that bad times are recurring faster than before, Anand said the revised underwriting model which the bank now follows should shield from the problem of shrinking business cycles. The bank, as is the case with many of its peers, is dipping extensively into credit guarantee schemes to be able to take the tail-risk out of the microfinance business.",

Shares of Whirlpool of India Ltd. gained over 5% on Monday, February 9, after its third quarter earnings and as brokerage firm Jefferies projected a 20% upside on the stock from its previous close.Jefferies has a \"hold\" recommendation on Whirlpool of India, with a target price of ₹1,030 per share.The company's third quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation  was in-line with the analyst's estimates, but its reported profit after tax  — which declined 40% from the previous year — missed estimates due to an exception loss of ₹3.88 crore, in view of the new labour code.Jefferies said the company's consolidated sales increased 4% from the previous year and were driven by share gains in the washers and air-conditioners segments.Its operating margin of 5.1% improved by 100 basis points from the previous year.However, its refrigerators segment was muted due to soft demand and competition, Jefferies said.The company's EBITDA was up 31% from the previous year.The parent company Whirlpool Corp sold 11% stake in Whirlpool of India in November 2025 and could retain 40% for the time being, Jefferies said.Whirlpool of India said the third quarter was a historic period for the firm. It mentioned that it declared the securing of its future in mid-October 2025, with a long-term deal signed with Whirlpool Corporation that ensured multi-decadal rights to usage of the Whirlpool brand. It also included long-term licensing agreements and over three years of a transitional services agreement.The company said all of this will allow it the interim systems stability needed to drive forward strongly in the future.Of the 13 analysts that have coverage on the stock, seven have a 'buy' rating, four have a 'hold' rating and two have a 'sell' rating on it.Shares of Whirlpool of India gained 5.1% to hit an intraday high of ₹898 apiece on Monday.

Towards the end of December 2024, futures contracts began trading at a discount to spot prices, a pattern the company said was abnormal and indicative of aggressive short positioning.Also Read: Sun TV rises nearly 4% as IPL valuation optimism outweighs weak Q3 performanceThe company said that on January 7, 2025, between 10:30 am and 11 am, multiple rumours started circulating in the market, including claims relating to the arrest of promoters and bribery of fund managers. Kalyan Jewellers has denied these allegations.In its submission, the company said it believes that short positions were built up from late December 2024, and that the rumours were released as part of a predetermined strategy immediately after its quarterly business update for the December quarter of FY25, which it released in early January, in line with its usual practice.Kalyan Jewellers further alleged that the suspected modus operandi involved taking short positions through futures and options, spreading misleading information on social media, and coordinated selling to amplify price declines. Over the same period, its market capitalisation declined from around ₹76,795 crore to ₹45,450 crore, according to figures cited by the company.Citing concerns over investor protection and market integrity, the company has urged SEBI to direct exchanges to suspend trading in its F&amp;O contracts as a precautionary measure.Emails sent to Sebi and Kalyan remained unanswered.Shares of Kalyan Jewellers have been witnessing heightened volatility in the last year despite steady earnings. After touching a lifetime high of ₹770 on December 2024, the stock has corrected 45% since then, currently trading around Rs 416 apiece, stock exchange data showed.On February 6, the company announced its Q3 results, where its net profit rose 90% year-on-year to ₹416 crore while revenue rose 42% to ₹10,343 crore, data showed.",

From a technical perspective, Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst – Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One, said the stock faced rejection near the strong resistance zone of Rs 24 and is currently positioned around its 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA). Echoing a cautious stance, AR Ramachandran, part-time Sebi-registered research analyst at Tips2trades, said YES Bank remains bearish on daily charts, with strong resistance at Rs 22.",

UGRO Capital, a private-equity-backed MSME lender, said it is recalibrating its strategy to prioritise profitability after recording a sharp expansion in its loan book over the past five years. According to the company, its asset under management (AUM) grew at a CAGR of 69% between FY20 and FY25, supported by a technology-led lending platform and a diversified MSME borrower base spanning enterprises with turnovers ranging from ₹ 20 lakh to ₹ 15 crore. With most branch and technology investments now front-loaded, the lender said it is shifting focus to return on assets (RoA), which it expects to improve from around 2.1% in FY26 to 3.4% by FY28. UGRO said it is rationalising its portfolio by trimming exposure to lower-yield segments such as select machinery loans and microfinance-linked assets, while increasing focus on embedded finance and cash-flow-linked lending with higher collection frequency.",

Abrasives and C&P, both key segments, reported modest revenue growth of 5.2% and 6.3% YoY, respectively.

Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairperson of the Tata Group, was present at the inauguration ceremony.The Panapakkam facility will supplement existing JLR assembly operations in India while also creating additional capacity for Tata Motors’ own passenger vehicle production.#WATCH | Ranipet, Tamil Nadu: Chief Minister MK Stalin inaugurates the new Tata Motors passenger vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover  manufacturing facility in Panapakkam, Ranipet district today at the SIPCOT complex.Chairperson of the Tata Group, Natarajan Chandrasekaran also… pic.twitter.com/6rjJLB3i9o— ANI  February 9, 2026Shailesh Chandra, MD and CEO of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, during the company’s Q3 FY26 earnings call, said JLR CKD assembly at Panapakkam will supplement operations at the Chakan plant near Pune.Chandra cited capacity constraints at Chakan and limited room for expansion at other plants as the reason for activating the Tamil Nadu site.He added that Tata Motors will also need additional capacity for its own passenger vehicle range. The added assembly line is intended to support that demand.The Panapakkam facility was commissioned in late 2024 and is located near Tamil Nadu’s ports, which support domestic distribution and exports, especially for electric vehicles.The unit spans about 470 acres within the SIPCOT complex. Of the total 1,200 acres acquired at the site, the remaining land will host other industrial projects.The company said the plant will run on 100% renewable energy and follow sustainability-linked manufacturing practices.Tata Motors had earlier outlined a planned investment of about ₹9,000 crore at the site, with the potential to create around 5,000 jobs. Annual production capacity is expected to rise in phases to as much as 2,50,000 vehicles.With the facility now operational, Tata Motors is looking to strengthen JLR’s position in India, which it views as a key growth market for luxury vehicles.Senior executives have also said there are no current plans to shift from CKD assembly to full local manufacturing of JLR vehicles.",

        "condensed_text": "Sterlite Technologies shares rallied over 8% on Monday, February 9, after Nuvama reiterated its Buy rating and maintained a target price of ₹200, citing improving growth momentum and an easing tariff environment.Nuvama said Sterlite Tech saw a sharp pickup in revenue growth in Q3, although margin remained under pressure due to tariff-related uncertainties. The brokerage expects the margin to improve following the US decision to lower reciprocal tariffs on Indian exports from 25% to 18%, along with the removal of the additional punitive 25% tariff, which it believes will be margin-accretive.The brokerage expects growth momentum to sustain, particularly in North America, supported by a recovery in demand from telecom operators and hyperscalers, easing trade conditions, Sterlite Tech’s local manufacturing footprint, and a sharper focus on its data centre portfolio.As per Bloomberg consensus data, Sterlite Tech has a consensus rating of 4.33, with 66.7% of analysts recommending ‘Buy’ and the remaining 33.3% maintaining a ‘Hold’. The consensus 12-month target price stands at ₹155.5, implying an upside of around 11% from the last traded price of ₹140.3.Among brokerages tracking the stock, Nuvama currently has the highest target price at ₹200, while other bullish calls include Maybank Investment Banking with a target of ₹215 and Equirus Securities at ₹226.The stock has delivered a one-year return of nearly 80%.Sterlite Tech reported a net loss of ₹17 crore in Q3FY26, compared with a net loss of ₹24 crore in the corresponding period last year. EBITDA rose 16.2% year-on-year to ₹129 crore from ₹111 crore a year earlier. EBITDA margin contracted 80 basis points year-on-year to 10.3% from 11.1% in the year-ago period.Shares of the company hit intraday highs of ₹143.70 in early trade on Monday, but have since pared some of their gains and are currently trading 4.72% up at ₹138.80.",

Now volumes have started coming, and value, which we had to sacrifice for volume for the last three quarters, that sacrifice part is over,\" he said.The company recently reported its October–December 2025 quarter results, where net profit rose 37.9% year-on-year to ₹266.7 crore, compared with ₹193.4 crore in the same period last year.Shree Cement currently has a market capitalisation of ₹96,443.84 crore. In terms of percentage, it will be 4 to 5%, but ₹10 to ₹15 is a good price rise.Q: Besides the volume growth being a bit of a disappointment, what's encouraging is that you have managed to bridge that price gap, let's say with UltraTech Cement. So, give and take everything, ₹150 to ₹200 price improvement in quarter four could be par for the course.A: Yes, of course, this will be about ₹150 to ₹200, and ₹1,200 EBITDA per tonne is not far off.Q: I want to ask you about the profitability. So, 4 to 5 million tonne of additional production is not going to matter much.Also Read | Cement, metals, banks: Dharmesh Kant’s playbook for the next 6–9 monthsQ: You believe everyone will prosper?A: Yes, we will also prosper.Q: What do you have to say about UltraTech Cement talking up the South industry?",

        "condensed_text": "These businesses, built and scaled over the last few years, now contribute a meaningful share of both revenues and the order pipeline.Management remains optimistic about these segments, citing sustained demand and long-term deal visibility, which continues to offset softness in select client accounts.In the October–December quarter , Sonata Software reported revenue of ₹3,080 crore, profit of ₹104 crore, and margins of 5.21%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: What about the AI led engagements? That's what we're seeing at this point in time.Q: I wanted to understand from a business standpoint, given the sort of conversations around AI, the new developments that are taking place globally as well, for a business like yours, what proportion of your revenue gets impacted by AI in the sense that AI capabilities can do that a lot better than what you are currently offering, or and concomitantly on your cost business, what proportion of AI can reduce your cost? But Sonata business is far more complex on modernisation and regulated industry perspective so we feel at this at this point in time, we are moving forward, embracing the changes that are happening in the industry, helping clients deliver faster, but really keeping a watchful eye on the future as well, because this technology still is evolving at this point in time.Q: In your third quarter numbers, there's a bit of a mixed bag when you look at the sectoral contribution. AI order book is increasing in a very healthy manner, which is much in line with their expectations.Now from a sectoral perspective, clearly we had large client issue in banking and a large client issue in Technology, Media and Telecom , so that's why the sectoral performances look not so good on those two sectors, just because of the two specific clients issue we had.In retail manufacturing, much in line what we have been saying, our tariff have been hitting us. So overall, very bullish about healthcare business, very bullish about where banking businesses, except for one client issue we have, and that's how the quarter came out for us.Q: Just for bookkeeping, if you could tell us a couple of things, the TMT, which is technology, media, telecom, HLS - healthcare and life sciences and RMD - retail, manufacturing, travel and distribution, how much do they contribute in terms of your current revenue, and what is their contribution in terms of your order book?",

This year, we have added around 3 LNG stations,” Shinghal said, adding that the company will continue to add 3.5 lakh domestic PNG (piped natural gas) connections in the next fiscal. Speaking on the reduction in APM (Administered Price Mechanism) gas allocation, Shinghal said the company’s dependency on APM has effectively decreased, and it is prepared for a further reduction. In April last year, the government cut the allocation of APM gas to city gas distributors by up to 20 percent, replacing it with equal or greater volumes of new well gas (NWG), which is more expensive. Shinghal noted that the reduction in APM is being offset by new well gas, high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) gas, spot purchases, Brent-linked contracts, and exchange-based sourcing.",

        "condensed_text": "The shares ofVodafone Idea(Vi) jumped nearly 5 percent on February 9 after data showed that promoter Kumar Mangalam Birla has bought additional stake in the telecom major from the open market. Kumar Managalam Birla buys additional stake in Vodafone Idea:\nKumar Mangalam Birla bought 2.21 crore shares on January 30, and 1.88 crore shares on February 1, according to market data cited by CNBC-TV18. Emkay Global on Vodafone Idea:\nEmkay Global upgraded the shares of Vodafone Idea to ‘Add’ from ‘Sell’, and doubled its target price to Rs 12 apiece from Rs 6 apiece earlier. The relief reduces the net present value (NPV) of the burden by 60–80%, easing immediate survival pressure, along with the possibility of further reduction on reassessment of AGR dues. However, Emkay noted that the key risks to its bullish call include inability to increase subscriber market share, significantly increase ARPU with tariff repair and upgrade the subscriber base from 2G to 4G/5G.",

Under the agreement, Lupin ​and its U.S. unit will pay\nAstellas ⁠a $75 million upfront payment and per-unit licensing\nfees on Mirabegron sales through September 2027, the ​company\nsaid in ⁠an exchange filing. In a separate statement, the Japanese drugmaker said the\nsettlement concludes its litigation with Lupin and ‌added that it\nis reviewing the ‌potential financial impact for the fiscal year\nending March 31, 2026. Lupin ‍had previously disclosed the patent dispute with\nAstellas last April over its generic ‍version of Myrbetriq,\nAstellas' overactive bladder drug, after a U.S. court ruling\nraised the risk that generic versions could be withdrawn from\nthe market. Citi analysts said the settlement removes legal uncertainty\naround Lupin's Mirabegron sales in the U.S. ⁠and could delay the\nentry of other generic rivals, potentially providing ​Lupin and\nZydus Lifesciences, another drugmaker involved in ⁠the\nlitigation, with a period of limited competition.",

        "condensed_text": "Delhi-based medical device maker Poly Medicure expects growth to be stronger in the second half compared to the first, with the company likely to end the year with an overall growth of around 20%.Himanshu Baid, Managing Director of Poly Medicure said the initial slowdown was largely due to softness in overseas markets, but that trend has started to reverse, providing better visibility on revenues going ahead.On the domestic side, the company is tracking overall growth of about 21–22%, led by the private segment, which is growing at a faster pace of around 25%.He said the margin impact during the third quarter was a one-off, mainly due to labour code changes and acquisition-related costs. He expects margins to improve from here as these exceptional costs fall away and the newly acquired subsidiaries scale up and improve their profitability.Baid remains optimistic about the next financial year, with subsidiaries expected to contribute more meaningfully and export markets in Europe and the US reopening after earlier delays.Europe is already showing signs of improvement, and export growth of 12–15% is currently visible, with clearer guidance expected by the end of the fourth quarter.In October-December quarter , Poly Medicure reported a revenue of ₹493 crore, profit of ₹70 crore and margins of 23%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: This year is going to be obviously a lower than estimated growth. This was a one-off quarter on a consolidated basis, the net margin level, but in terms of gross margins, we have improved by actually 200-300 basis points in the current quarter.Q: Margin should get back to 25-27% and on the topline you maintain the 15 to 16% growth guidance?A: If you see a current quarter, we have done close to 15-16% growth from the previous quarter, and this quarter also will see a similar number. Next year also, we should see a similar growth unless, until there is a big change in the duty structure, or there is something intervention by the government, we don't see moving back to that 35-40% number.Q: Have you reached out to the government, for some sort of protection against dumping by China on renal products?A: We have reached out and we are working on that. Hopefully government is working on it and we will see something in next few months coming up.Q: On this India US trade deal for medtech products, the tariff has been cut from 15 to 18% if you could give perspective on the industry, what percentage is India's exports to the US from an industry point of view, how would it compare with, say, you know, from a country like China?",

As part of this engagement, Adani Enterprises, through its legal counsel, received a formal Request for Information (RFI) from OFAC dated February 4, 2026 (India time) and February 3, 2026 (US time). The disclosure follows allegations highlighted in the June 2025 Wall Street Journal report, which had claimed thatGautam Adaniwas seeking intervention from officials in the administration of then US President Donald Trump to have foreign bribery charges dropped. Adani Group had denied the allegations at the time, stating that it had not engaged in sanctions evasion or trade involving Iranian-origin LPG and that it was not aware of any investigation by US authorities on the matter.",

        "condensed_text": "Citi Research said Lupin's $90-million patent settlement with Astellas Pharma may prevent other generic drugmakers from launching generic Mirabegron for an extended period, potentially giving Lupin and Zydus Lifesciences about 12–18 months of limited competition. Lupin said on Tuesday it agreed to a $90-million settlement with Japan's Astellas Pharma in a patent dispute over the bladder disorder drug Mirabegron, a move that allows it to continue selling the product in the United States. Under the agreement, Lupin and its US unit will pay Astellas a $75 million upfront payment and per-unit licensing fees on Mirabegron sales through September 2027, the company said in an exchange filing. In a separate statement, the Japanese drugmaker said the settlement concludes its litigation with Lupin and added that it is reviewing the potential financial impact for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026. Lupin had previously disclosed the patent dispute with Astellas last April over its generic version of Myrbetriq, Astellas' overactive bladder drug, after a U.S. court ruling raised the risk that generic versions could be withdrawn from the market.",

And I don’t want Bangladesh to suffer,” Lalbhai said, noting that Bangladesh remains a key end market for the company’s fabric business and that Arvind has a “high dependency” on India’s eastern neighbour. “It could be an opportunity on the yarn side because yarn prices will go down, but that’s not good for India because we have a lot of yarn capacity that has come up. “We are having conversations with customers, and we are reallocating a lot of internal marketing and sales resources to focus on these geographies so that we can build the pipeline before the implementation of the duty-free tariff,” Lalbhai said. “If I have $1 to invest, I will invest it in garmenting because garmenting is easier to sell and customers increasingly want a vertical offering rather than just fabric.",

        "condensed_text": "Shares of one of India’s leading steel manufacturers, Tata Steel , rose as much as 4.5% to their day’s high of Rs 911 on the BSE on Tuesday, extending gains for a second session in a row following the company’s third quarter earnings. In India, spreads are likely to expand as a Rs 3,500 per tonne recovery in HRC spot prices could lift blended NSRs by around Rs 2,300 per tonne QoQ, factoring in product mix and contracts. Consolidated volumes are projected to rise 10% YoY to around 9.2 MT in Q4FY26F, leading to an estimated sequential increase of about Rs 400 per tonne in consolidated EBITDA to roughly Rs 10,400 per tonne. Elara Capital has reiterated its Accumulate rating on Tata Steel and raised its target price to Rs 215 from Rs 187, citing the recent uptick in steel prices since mid-December and the imposition of safeguard duties on imports, which are expected to support near-term earnings growth. Elara noted that the anticipated reduction in funding overhang from domestic operations toward EU businesses has led it to revise the valuation multiple for domestic operations to 6.5x EV/EBITDA from 6.0x earlier, while retaining a 5.0x multiple for other businesses.",

        "condensed_text": "I-PAC raids: SC adjourns to Feb 18 ED's plea against 'interference' by Mamata Banerjee. The Supreme Court on Tuesday adjourned to February 18 the hearing on a plea moved by the ED alleging obstruction by the West Bengal government, including by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in its search operation at the I-PAC office and the premises of its director in connection with an alleged coal pilferage scam.A bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Sandeep Mehta deferred the matter after it was informed that senior advocate Kapil Sibal was unwell.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta agreed to the adjournment.The top court on January 15 said the West Bengal chief minister’s alleged \"obstruction\" in ED’s probe is \"very serious\" and agreed to examine if a state’s law-enforcing agencies can interfere with any central agency’s probe into any serious offence as it stayed FIRs against the agency’s officials who raided political consultancy I-PAC on January 8.The top court, while staying the FIRs filed in West Bengal against ED officials, also directed the state police to protect the CCTV footage of the raids.It had issued notices to Banerjee, the West Bengal government, DGP Rajeev Kumar and top cops on the ED’s petitions seeking a CBI probe against them for allegedly obstructing raids at I-PAC premises.The ED has also alleged that Banerjee entered the raid sites and took away ”key” evidence, including physical documents and electronic devices, from the premises of I-PAC and obstructed and interfered with the investigation in the case.The ED has further claimed in its plea that the chief minister’s presence at the search site and the alleged removal of documents had an intimidating effect on officers and seriously compromised the federal probe agency’s ability to discharge its statutory functions independently.The ED’s plea in the apex court follows events from January 8, when the agency conducted searches on the premises of I-PAC and its director Pratik Jain in Kolkata as part of a money-laundering probe into the alleged multi-crore-rupee coal-pilferage scam.During the search operation, Banerjee reached the I-PAC office along with senior TMC leaders, confronted the ED officials and allegedly took away documents from the premises. The chief minister has accused the central agency of overreach.The West Bengal Police has also registered an FIR against ED officers.The TMC has denied the ED’s allegation of obstruction.It has further alleged that the ED action against I-PAC, the election consultant of the party, was aimed at accessing confidential election-strategy material.The party has maintained that I-PAC functions as its election strategist and that the ED’s action was intended to disrupt its electoral preparations rather than pursuing any bona fide investigation in the case.Assembly polls are due in West Bengal in a few months.",

        "condensed_text": "The recent rebound in small-cap stocks is durable and has much more upside, supported by fundamentals and fresh liquidity, says Nimesh Chandan, Chief Investment Officer at Bajaj Finserv AMC.Explaining why he believes the recovery is sustainable after the recent bounce, Chandan said, “I think it is durable because it is backed by fundamentals. It was the sentiment, which was under pressure, and with the recent news of trade deals, that sentiment has recovered, and with the kind of deal that we've got with the US, I think there's more to come. So, there is much more to come.”Putting recent earnings performance into perspective, Chandan highlighted the sharp outperformance of small caps but cautioned on sustainability, saying, “This quarter, the small caps have delivered much better earnings growth… So large caps have so far given about 12% kind of profit growth. However, you should also look at the basis of how they were last year.”Outlining why the broader business environment in India is improving, he said, “Overall, we are in a better position compared to the last 12 months, because we are seeing the pickup on the consumption side. The cost of capital has come down over the last 12 months, and that is also helping businesses… if your cost of capital is coming down, your domestic market is picking up, and you have prospects in the export market, I think there isa  lot to play with.”Also Read: Global markets are fragile; be cautious with fresh investments, warns Richard HarrisOn whether the sharp earnings growth in small caps can continue, Chandan said sentiment is improving, but growth will normalise, adding, “The sentiment is getting better… from whatever interactions we've had with companies, sentiment is getting better… I don't think this 30% kind of growth can continue, but there is a lot to play within this small cap space now, where quality businesses are seeing some revival in growth and valuations are attractive because the entire category went through a correction in the last few months.”Explaining where his fund is finding opportunities, Chandan said, “We've seen selectively now within different pockets… materials, we are seeing good amount of action in cement, metals and even some of the chemicals companies… within consumer discretionary, now, we are seeing an improvement in demand… within industrial… capital goods, even within power, we are seeing many companies giving good numbers… except for maybe the IT sector, which is again, a top down kind of a negative view that we have.”Detailing how he is positioned for the economic upcycle, he said, “If you see in our portfolio, what we have done is we have added cement across the space… whether it is large cap… and then there are a couple of good mid cap companies… and a couple of small caps there… Metals, again, for ferrous and nonferrous, there are clear leaders in the space, and we go with the largest companies in this area… We have added more weightage among BFSI to private banks… So these three sectors, if you see industrials, materials and financials, these are the sectors you play with the up move or the economic upcycle.”Also Read: HDFC Life, SBI Life and Max Financial now on similar footing, Bernstein cautious on PB FintechOn the information technology sector, Chandan said weak sentiment is likely to persist, even though a sharp fall is unlikely, stating, “If sentimental negative will carry for some time… every few months probably you will see… because every company is working towards productivity gains… I think this hangover will continue for some time, and it will weigh on the valuations… But the cash flows, the return on capital ratios, the dividend payments or even buybacks… may not lead to a severe fall in the IT sector.",

        "condensed_text": "Chalet Hotels, part of the K Raheja Corp group, expects the hospitality sector to stay on a firm footing over the next couple of years, helped by strong travel demand and a persistent demand-supply gap.Shwetank Singh, MD &amp; CEO of Chalet Hotels highlighted that although January was relatively muted, demand picked up meaningfully in February and has stayed steady into March, keeping the company confident about a solid close to the financial year.Singh expects the next two to three years to remain favourable for the hospitality industry, with revenue per available room growth likely to stay in double digits, led more by rising average room rates than occupancy gains.Chalet Hotels is strengthening its portfolio through the Athiva brand, while maintaining balance-sheet comfort with stable debt levels and adequate headroom to fund future expansions and acquisitions.In October-December quarter , Chalet Hotels reported revenues of ₹581, profit after tax of ₹124 crore and margins of 45.6%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: What does your target stand at in terms of revenue, and what is the expectation now that we should have for FY27?A: Unfortunately, it's hard for me to give you forward numbers, but it has been an excellent growth for us. If I look at quarter three numbers at a consolidated level, we grew revenue by about 27%, with EBITDA growing by 29% but ex-residential, which is a one-off we normally see our business ex-residential, and that's also grown 23% on revenue and 24% on EBITDA, quarter-on-quarter.The other good thing is, on a nine-month consolidated basis, we have grown 24% on revenue to about ₹15,103 odd crores, and about ₹677, crores at EBITDA level, for 28% year-on-year growth. Would that be a fair estimate?A: It's interesting you say that because that if you see pan India numbers for the calendar year, and not talking financial year, because most operators report calendar year numbers, we have come in at about 67% occupancy so far pan India at about ₹8,800 average daily rate , and that brings the revenue per available room  to say ₹5,500 and that growth has been quite steady and very encouraging. Some of the stuff that came through this time is also very heartening, because the approach of the government, clearly, is to improve the overall tourism infrastructure, and not just focus on one part of tourism, and that's one of the things that has been lacking in the country.The experience of tourists who have to be seen holistically and not just one segment of their holiday, so it's great that the government is looking at it that way. So, as a company, we have not moved away from third party operations, Athiva is one of the offerings, and yes, we will favour it, but we will continue to assess it in a dispassionate manner.Finally, just to finish up on debt, our debt remains at about ₹2,000 odd crores that has not moved dramatically from the last time we spoke, and we are very comfortable, sort of placed, both from an internal accrual perspective and headroom to take more debt to sort of fund all our future expansions and acquisitions as they come.Live stock market updates—follow our blog",

The fall in bottom line was driven by margin contraction amid a higher cost base.Revenue from operations rose 6.5% YoY to ₹775 crore, up from ₹728 crore a year ago, supported by stable demand across product segments and continued execution momentum during the quarter.EBITDA declined 3.8% YoY to ₹60.6 crore, compared with ₹61 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Inventory movement remained favourable, with a reduction of ₹15.9 crore during the quarter.Employee benefit expenses were ₹9.1 crore, finance costs stood at ₹2.4 crore, and depreciation and amortisation expense was ₹3.4 crore. Other expenses for the quarter were ₹49.7 crore.Overall, the quarter reflected stable topline growth but pressure on margins, as higher costs offset revenue gains, keeping profitability under check despite healthy operational activity.Panama Petrochem Ltd  is an Indian specialty‑petrochemical manufacturer that makes and sells chemicals derived from crude‑oil/ base‑oil feedstock to industrial customers. The company runs plants in India and the UAE and exports to the Middle East, Africa, and other regions.For the nine months ended December, Panama Petrochem’s revenue from operations grew 6.9% YoY to ₹2,241.5 crore, compared with ₹2,097.7 crore a year ago.",

The company also expects continued growth in home care and allied businesses over the medium term.Speaking from the sidelines of the 21st Nuvama India Conference, Abhay Soi, Chairman and MD, Max Healthcare, said the company has stopped supplying certain oncology drugs under government pricing rules due to cost economics.He said, “As far as the oncology drugs are concerned… we had margins of about close to 18%, but as a part of the new pricing for CGHS… the pricing has been capped to 70% of the maximum retail price. So clearly, we’ve discontinued that.”Also Read | Max Healthcare Q3 Results: Revenue up 9% YoY; occupancy dips, ARPOB rises 3%Soi said discussions are ongoing with the government to review the pricing framework. He added that CGHS patients can access these medicines through government dispensaries, while patients under other public sector schemes may face access challenges as hospitals cannot supply medicines below procurement cost.On hospital operating metrics, Soi said comparisons in average revenue per occupied bed  need to factor in new hospital additions in tier-2 cities.He said, “We need to look at it apples to apples… the new hospitals, if they’re in tier-2 cities, the ARPOBs and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation  per bed may be lower, but we are in the business of putting incremental capital at attractive RoCEs.”He added that quarterly case mix also changes due to seasonal disease patterns, which impact occupancy and revenue metrics.On insurance-related disruptions seen earlier, Soi said service continuity is expected after renewal agreements and new operating mechanisms.He said, “We’ve signed renewals… and we believe, because of the new mechanism that has been adopted, we will not have these issues occurring again.”Also Read | Earnings stabilising but valuations still a hurdle for markets: Kotak's Sanjeev PrasadOn growth segments, Soi said home healthcare and related services have delivered steady expansion over multiple years.He said these businesses have grown at about a 20–25% compounded annual growth rate  and may continue to scale, supported by demand and potential insurance coverage expansion. He added that home ICU treatment costs are significantly lower compared to hospital ICU stays.On policy revisions under CGHS, Soi said the overall financial impact remains positive despite tax-related offsets.He said, “Net, net, we should see a benefit of about close to ₹200 crore as far as margins are concerned… There will also be a negative impact as far as goods and services tax  is concerned, which should be about ₹60 crore… but net impact is positive.”The company, which has a current market capitalisation of ₹99,440.35 crore, has seen its shares lose more than 4% over the last year.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

Gross margins are expected to stay around 40%, similar to last year, while EBITDA margins may see a dip of about 100–125 basis points due to operating pressures and subdued demand conditions.Dhanuka continues to benefit from its partnership with Bayer. The current economic arrangement with Bayer will continue until June 30, 2026, after which revenues will start directly flowing into Dhanuka’s books.The bio-stimulant business, however, faced a temporary setback following a regulatory ban, impacting sales in FY26.

        "condensed_text": "The company is leaning on gold exchange programs, wider price options, and a stronger push into natural diamonds to support growth in the coming quarters.Arun Narayan, CEO – Jewellery at Titan, said sharp swings in gold prices have changed buying behaviour rather than dampened demand. Wedding buyers, in particular, are advancing purchases amid fears of further price increases, while store footfalls rise whenever prices soften.“Whenever there is a dip, you have more people in stores wanting to buy, and whenever it goes up a bit, you have people staying on the sidelines in the hope that it will come down,” Narayan said, adding that customer anxiety should ease once prices stabilise.High gold prices have accelerated the trend of exchanging old jewellery for new. The company believes this has helped bring back customers who were earlier hesitant due to rising prices, while also supporting jewellery demand even at elevated gold levels.Titan is also making jewellery more accessible through monthly gold buying plans, lightweight designs, lower-carat gold, and a wider range of diamond jewellery. The company plans to set up diamond expertise centres across Tanishq stores, with equipment to authenticate natural diamonds and explain quality parameters to customers.“Very soon we would reach about 50 stores where we have equipment to authenticate natural diamonds,” Narayan said.The company has also launched the “Soulmate Diamond Pair”, a pair of engagement rings created from the same rough diamond. This is part of Titan’s effort to build trust, transparency, and emotional appeal in the natural diamond category, especially during the Valentine and wedding seasons.On the retail front, Titan plans steady domestic expansion, with 30–40 new stores opening every year.",

        "condensed_text": "Bloomberg\nThe White House has removed “pulses” from a list of American products on which it said India will eliminate or reduce tariffs, in a revised fact sheet issued on the interim trade deal. On Monday, the White House had issued a fact sheet on ‘The United States and India Announce Historic Trade Deal (Interim Agreement),’ days after India and the US announced in a joint statement the framework for an Interim Agreement regarding reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade. An initial version of the fact sheet had highlighted key terms of the agreement including, that India will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a wide range of US food and agricultural products, including dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, “certain pulses”, soybean oil, wine and spirits, and additional products. The revised fact sheet issued Tuesday removed the reference made regarding pulses and changed the word committed used for India to “intends.” \t“India will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a wide range of US food and agricultural products, including dried distillers’ grains (DDGs), red sorghum, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits, and additional products. The joint statement had also maintained that “India intends to purchase $500 billion of US energy products, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products, and coking coal over the next 5 years.”\nPublished on  February 11, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",
