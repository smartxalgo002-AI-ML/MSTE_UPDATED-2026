However, on a sequential basis, the net profit showed improvement by 30% as it stood at ₹ 51 crore in the September quarter (Q2FY26).\nTotal income for the December quarter stood at ₹ 240.1 crore, up from ₹ 203.8 crore in the corresponding quarter last year and ₹ 224.0 crore in Q2 FY26. The company posted a net income of ₹ 243 crore as compared to ₹ 181 crore in the year ago quarter.\nThe net interest income stood at ₹ 148 crore as compared to ₹ 99 crore in December 2024 quarter, as per the company's earnings' filing.\nMeanwhile, the company has recently been in the spotlight. In late January, the company had announced that it had redeemed ₹ 1 crore of unlisted, unsecured, redeemable, non-convertible debentures (NCDs) by exercising an early call option. According to the company, the move will help reduce long-term debt well ahead of the instruments scheduled maturity.\nEarlier this year, Paisalo Digital raised ₹ 188.5 crore as part of its efforts to optimise funding costs, improve capital efficiency, and support business expansion. The small-cap NBFC mobilised the funds during the third quarter through its latest listed issuances, securing an annual return on investment of 8.5%.\nIn an exchange filing dated January 6, the company said it had “successfully raised nearly ₹ 188.5 crore at an annual ROI of 8.5% through its latest listed issuances in Q3,” adding that the fundraise underscored its strong credit profile, prudent risk-management practices, and solid balance-sheet position.\nPaisalo Digital also noted that the capital infusion is expected to lower its overall cost of funds, strengthen its medium-term capital base, and expand its lending capacity.",

        "full_content": "FILE PHOTO: A view shows high-tension electricity power line pylon outside Adani Power's thermal power generation plant at Mundra in the western state of Gujarat, India\nAMIT DAVE\nAs India’s power grid tilts rapidly towards renewables, Adani Power is repositioning its thermal fleet as a support system for grid stability, with plants increasingly acting as balancing power sources to enable larger renewable integration, even as the company rolls out a 24-GW capacity expansion plan through FY32 backed by long-term power purchase agreements.\n“Now the entire game has become to keep generation capacity available to help integrate more renewable power into the grid and to continue to supply base load power. The (thermal) power plants will now act more as balancing power plants and therefore the focus will be on keeping the plant uptime as high as possible, rather than actually trying to maximise the PLF,” said Dilip Jha, Chief Financial Officer of Adani Power.\nJha said the upcoming capacities will be built using advanced technology to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.\nThe power plants that we are setting up… will use a lesser amount of coal to generate higher amounts of power — up to 5–10 percent of advantage when compared to older technology,” he recently told investors adding that most projects are located close to coal sources, helping lower logistics costs.\nThe company currently operates 18.5 GW of capacity, of which around 90 percent is tied up under long- and medium-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with state distribution companies (DISCOMs).\n“For the new capacities that we are planning to set up we intend to tie up for long term PPAs, so going forward we are reducing our merchant exposure,” Jha said.\nAdani Power is executing a 23.7-GW thermal expansion programme, with multiple brownfield projects progressing across central and eastern India. Mahan Phase-2 is around 80 per cent complete, Raipur Phase-2 about 44 per cent, Raigarh Phase-2 close to 38 pe rcent, while construction at Korba Phase-2 has resumed, the company said.\nThese projects are scheduled to be commissioned in phases starting FY27. “Broadly speaking, around 2.9 GW will be commissioned next year. In FY28, another 2.4 GW, FY29 another 2.4 GW, FY30 about 8 GW, FY31 around 5.6 GW and another 2.4 GW thereafter,” Jha said, adding that the revived Korba Phase-2 project will see its first unit commissioned by mid-next year and the second by year-end.\nOn demand trends, Jha said higher hydro generation and renewable output during the extended monsoon temporarily reduced thermal power’s share in the energy mix during Q3FY26.\nThermal contribution fell to 73 percent from 76 percent earlier, while renewables and large hydro increased to 24 percent from around 20 per cent.\n“This is transient,” he said, adding that rising household consumption and industrial activity are expected to drive long-term demand.\nIndia’s peak power requirement could rise to 380–400 GW by FY32, which would continue to support demand for thermal power even as renewable capacity expands.\nPublished on  February 6, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",
