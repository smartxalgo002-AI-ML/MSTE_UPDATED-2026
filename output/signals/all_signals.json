In 2024 Indian refiners imported an average of about 70,000 barrels per day from Venezuela with shipments exceeding 150,000 bpd in two months according to Kpler shipping data. “Venezuelan crudes are heavy and sour and therefore cheaper and would be of interest to Indian refiners many of whom can process these types of crudes,” said Prashant Vasisht Senior Vice President and Co Group Head Corporate Ratings at ICRA Ltd .

India has not received a single cargo of Venezuelan crude since May 2025 but Trump’s remarks have raised expectations of a resumption of trade. In 2024 Indian refiners imported an average of about 70,000 barrels per day from Venezuela with shipments exceeding 150,000 bpd in two months according to Kpler shipping data. “Venezuelan crudes are heavy and sour and therefore cheaper and would be of interest to Indian refiners many of whom can process these types of crudes,” said Prashant Vasisht Senior Vice President and Co Group Head Corporate Ratings at ICRA Ltd . Reliance Industries’ refineries can process the extremely heavy and sour crude positioning the conglomerate as a direct beneficiary of any Venezuelan oil resumption. Minimal impact from Russian crude exit Vasisht noted that for the Indian refining sector there are ample avenues including the US to purchase crude as Russian crude accounted for less than 2% of Indian crude imports prior to FY2023. Live Events Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 discounted Russian crude flooded the Indian market. Venezuelan oil dropped out of India’s import basket last year but Trump’s latest signal could pave the way for its return as a meaningful supply source. Iranian barrels that once accounted for about 10% of India’s crude imports were replaced by supplies from the US and other producers after 2019 demonstrating India’s ability to swiftly reconfigure its crude sourcing strategy. While the Indian side has not commented officially Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil and to buy much more from the United States and potentially Venezuela. The development plays directly into Reliance Industries’ refining capabilities and cost structure. RIL shares have been under pressure amid uncertainty around Russian and Venezuela imports and are still down around 8% this calendar year so far. Its Q3 results which were also impacted by lower than expected performance in the retail business amid a slowdown in discretionary consumer spending offered investors little to chew on.

It said GAIL’s ability to defend gas marketing margins amid rising gas costs and a recovery in transmission volumes underpins its positive stance, while noting that petrochemical profitability remained a drag during the quarter.\nMotilal Oswal reiterated its buy at target price of ₹190, projecting a 19 per cent compound annual growth in profit over FY26–28. The brokerage expects this to be driven by higher gas transmission volumes, improved performance in the petrochemical business as new capacity comes on stream and spreads recover, and healthy profitability in the trading segment. It also forecast return on equity stabilising above 12.5 per cent and strong free cash flow generation over the period.\nNuvama Institutional Equities, however, struck a cautious note, highlighting delays in tariff hikes and a prolonged downcycle in petrochemicals. The brokerage said GAIL’s Q3 EBITDA missed consensus expectations mainly because of weaker petchem earnings, while transmission volumes were flat year on year. It cut its FY27 and FY28 estimates and maintained a reduce rating with a target price of ₹151.\nPublished on  February 3, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

Emkay Global raised its volume estimate to factor in the strong ramp up via the EL platform (built in ASP moderation) and believe that Ather can achieve Ebitda and PAT breakeven in H2FY27. The stock rose 12.88 per cent to hit a high of Rs 684.85.\nDuring the quarter, Ather Energy sold 67,851 units, captured a national market share of 18.8 per cent, and improved Ebitda margin by 1,600 basis points (bps) year-on-year (YoY) to minus 3 per cent. Losses continued to shrink, with Ebitda loss down to Rs 29.9 crore, and the quarterly loss narrowing by 45 per cent compared to Q2FY26.\nNomura said store expansion, and launch of the “EL” platform in FY27E should be key growth drivers.

The company said exports crossed six lakh units during the current quarter and expects record export revenue in dollar terms in the fiscal year 2025-26 .“Quarter four will sustain at the levels,” Sharma said adding that the company's exports are growing at about 15 to 18%.For 2026-27 , export growth will depend on global demand and market conditions. Sharma said the company will respond to market trends quarter by quarter, adding that international business is influenced by multiple factors including global economics and geopolitical trends.Bajaj Auto recently reported results for the October-December 2025 quarter, supported by growth across domestic, export and electric vehicle segments. Profit was slightly below market expectations during the quarter.The company currently has a market capitalisation of ₹2.71 lakh crore, and its shares have gained more than 8% over the past one year.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: Give us your overarching view on the India-US trade deal. I know predominantly you cater more to Latin America and Africa, so your exports to North America are fairly limited. But how does it change the industry? And as it is under Section 232, broadly, what have you picked up?A: It's certainly welcome news. Quantitatively for Bajaj Auto exports to the US, which we do under the Triumph and KTM brands accounts for about a percentage of our total exports. So even when the tariffs went up, we were, on an overall basis, not impacted by it. So now, when the tariffs are down, the same sort of holds.Also Read | US-India trade deal removes tariff overhang, clears air for investors: Nisha BiswalHowever, having said that, as we build up our business with KTM Austria, and through them, accessing markets like the US, we do foresee more and more production shifting into India, and therefore, we will be making more US-relevant products in the future. And having these tariffs will certainly be very helpful from that point of view.And beyond that, the signal, which goes out from a sentiment point of view with the US and India aligning, there are so many other things, we trade in US dollars there, and so it's good to have this positive sentiment all around. It's good for trade.Q: Monthly exports on the whole, you're crossing the two-lakh mark. So, this quarter, it's been in excess of six lakh. And you've also said that the company expects exports to deliver the highest-ever top-line performance in dollar terms in FY26. How do you see the export momentum, particularly for Q4? Does the two-lakh momentum get stronger per month? And for FY27, do you have a number in mind?A: I think Q4 will sustain at the levels which we have been doing. We've been growing at about 15 to 18%. Q4 tends to be a bit shorter, because we tend to complete our exports by March 20 or so. So, you have, in that respect, fewer days. But the tempo should be maintained, and we are hoping to, on average, still clock over 200,000 units per month as an average in Q4.Going beyond that, we are going to be responding to the market quarter by quarter. At this point as things are now, it looks as if we will be sort of trying to inch up above this number in FY27, but international businesses have several moving parts, microeconomics, geopolitics, etc., so it's very difficult to crystal-ball gaze. But at this point in time, we would be looking forward to maintaining this kind of tempo, even in FY27.Q: What about margins? If you could talk about the commodity inflation that you have seen in Q3, expectations for Q4, and even in terms of offsetting measures via price hikes.A: So the margin story is not a very difficult one at this point in time. Yes, there has been an increase in the noble metals package, quite substantial increases, but they have been offset by flattish performance of steel and rubber and some natural products. So, on balance, from the commodity side, there has been a little bit of inflation, which we have taken action on early January to plough those back.Now, as we move forward, the softness in the Indian rupee has been very helpful, and with the rupee trading at 90 plus to the dollar, that is a very significant tailwind. So, we're not under any kind of great pressure to manage the margin story, given these things. So, we will always be looking at competition and the impact on demand, etc., and responding to those factors, rather than the cost side factors.Also Read | India–US trade deal: Auto stocks gain up to 20% led by Balkrishna IndustriesQ: Baseline margins of 20% plus should sustain.A: Hopefully.Q: And the EV markets— you have pulled back a good amount of market share, close to around 500 basis points. Do you believe you can go even higher from here? And your earlier competitor, Ola, is struggling out there. Have you had a look at their business?A: All the time. Because you know that we had a major supply chain dislocation in two-wheelers and three-wheelers, and therefore, quarter three, clawing back five percentage points of market share and getting back to a firm number two after having slipped down the league table is welcome. And almost in the closing period of quarter three, we also launched a new edition, which sort of opens up a new segment for the Chetak scooter.The Chetak C 25 is targeted specifically at youth and women. And that should open up opportunities, so the Chetak portfolio has been bolstered, and we will therefore obviously be looking forward to improving our market share in quarter four. Electric three wheelers also — we had slipped out, but there, the return has been quite rapid, and we are, for the last two months now, at the number one position. I think in January, we've exited at about 38% market share in the E-auto segment.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

An early onset of summer in southern India and a healthy order book underpin the company’s confidence of meeting its full-year guidance, even as January demand remained soft due to excess stocking in December.In October-December quarter , PG Electroplast reported revenue of ₹ 1,412 crore, profit after tax ₹60 crore and margins at 8.30%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: Is there a possibility that you can out beat this guidance - 17 to 19% revenue growth and the PAT number from ₹300 crores for FY26?A: I would like to stick to the revenue guidance that we have given of ₹5,800 crore. Is that correct?A: Yes.Q: This time was a room air conditioning  business, but I understand there was an account of the energy changes which come in, and there was a channel filling so going forward in quarter four or first half of FY27 which is also sort of the peak market for you, what kind of growth should we expect for the RAC business?A: I would look at quarter three, where the brands were picking up lot of inventory because of the price increase in the models of different air conditioners based on the rating energy table change. So that led to the good growth of AC sales in our quarter three numbers, and December was one of the best sales months for us, for air conditioners.We feel going forward in in in the quarter four of FY26 we are seeing that the inventory is still there in the channel, and that inventory still needs to be picked up. We remain optimistic based on the guidance and the based of the order book that we have with us from our clients.Q: What's the update on the compressor JV, we have been talking about that in the past, but what is the latest?A: I would say the compressor thing is still moving, and we are hopeful that we should be able to close in next, I would say, three to four weeks.",

Vikas Gupta, Managing Director of PG Electroplast is confident about a demand recovery after a volatile first half of the year.The December quarter marked a sharp turnaround, with revenues rising over 45% year-on-year, driven largely by a strong rebound in the room air-conditioner  segment following aggressive channel stocking ahead of the January 2026 energy rating transition.While Q3 benefited from pre-buying by brands, management indicated that elevated inventory levels across the channel could weigh on near-term volumes.The focus in the coming weeks will be on inventory normalisation and the pace of secondary sales as the summer season approaches.

We need to see how the next three to four weeks will look out. January month was a little tough because there was a lot of inventory which was already build-up in the month of December. We are hopeful that the going period of next six to eight weeks would be better for us.Q: PAT will be around ₹300 crores by the end of this year. Is that correct?A: Yes.Q: This time was a room air conditioning  business, but I understand there was an account of the energy changes which come in, and there was a channel filling so going forward in quarter four or first half of FY27 which is also sort of the peak market for you, what kind of growth should we expect for the RAC business?A: I would look at quarter three, where the brands were picking up lot of inventory because of the price increase in the models of different air conditioners based on the rating energy table change. So that led to the good growth of AC sales in our quarter three numbers, and December was one of the best sales months for us, for air conditioners.We feel going forward in in in the quarter four of FY26 we are seeing that the inventory is still there in the channel, and that inventory still needs to be picked up. We are just hoping that the summer onset should start in Southern India in next two or three weeks, we are doing our own channel checks, and still the market has not opened up. We remain confident and that that market should open up and we should be able to meet the sales guidance that we have given for our company. We remain optimistic based on the guidance and the based of the order book that we have with us from our clients.Q: What's the update on the compressor JV, we have been talking about that in the past, but what is the latest?A: I would say the compressor thing is still moving, and we are hopeful that we should be able to close in next, I would say, three to four weeks. We are hopeful, and it is still work in progress. There is a positive moment on that, and let us hope that we should be able to close it in next three to four weeks.Q: Just give us a sense about inventory, because you mentioned that a couple of times that inventory is still high in the system. Could you tell us what is the norm and in number of days, what is it currently?A: Inventory, we need to look at two different levels. One is the inventory at our company level and the inventory in the channel with the trade partners. So, when you look at the inventory at our level, and the normalised level of inventory in the peak season should not be more than 30 to 40 days. And still, we are sitting at almost around 45 to 50 days inventory, which we are expecting that should get normalised in month of February and March.Regarding the channel inventory, yes, there has been lot of push of the inventory by all the brands to the channel partners, before the change of the energy table. So, there is an inventory sitting in the channel, and we are just hoping that it gets cleared with the secondary sales picking up in the coming two, three weeks.Q: Just a quick word on commodity price inflation, because for room ACs copper is a big one. We have seen this in previous cycles, it doesn't hurt and then suddenly starts to gross margins, etc, start to come under pressure. Your thoughts?A: Definitely the commodity prices are playing lot of pressure on the bill of material cost, and we are in active discussion with all of our clients for the price increases. In some cases, we have been able to achieve the price increase. In some cases, still under discussion. Definitely, there is always a lag. Whenever there is a price increase coming in, there is a lag, and we are in discussion, so it might put some pressure on the EBITDA margin for which we have already guided. If you look at the EBITDA guidance that we have given for FY26 is slightly lower than the EBITDA that we were able to achieve in FY25. So, we are hopeful that we should be able to get the price increase done with most of the clients.The prices that we settle with our clients are mostly on the monthly and the quarterly basis.Q: What was the impact of commodity inflation on your margins. Quarter three margins were 8.3% nine months were close to 7.5%.A: If you look at the previous nine months, the hit on the margin was because of the other issues, like the inventory carrying cost. It was not largely because of the commodity. The commodity prices have started moving up in last three, four months only. So that impact is still about to come in, but we are hopeful that we should be able to get the price increase from the clients.Q: How many of your clients, what percentage of your clients have accepted a price increase already? What is the extent of price increase?A: Whatever, the commodity increase is always kind of a pass through to all our clients. And I would say, in the case of 60 to 70% the clients, we have already been able to get the price increase.PG Electroplast’s current market capitalisation is ₹16,695.42 crore.

December 2025 distributions are yet to be credited, which could further lift overall returns.According to Madhubani Sengupta, Head – Knowledge Services, ICRA Analytics, the year-on-year trend shows mixed movement within the trusts space, even as the overall category strengthened.“REITs nearly doubled their returns, rising from 16.81% in 2024 to 29.68% in 2025, reflecting sustained leasing momentum and consistent yield profiles.

As a result, sovereign bonds underperformed, while listed trusts continued to attract strong demand due to predictable cash flows, competitive yields, and rising interest in real estate- and infrastructure-backed investments.ICRA Analytics said public trusts have positioned themselves as a resilient alternative to traditional equities and fixed-income products, particularly for investors seeking regular distributions alongside capital appreciation.",

The US has agreed to lower reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports from 25% to 18% and has removed the punitive 25% duty on Indo-Russian oil trade. This 32 percentage point reduction places Indian exports in a more competitive position and is anticipated to trigger a chain reaction of market and economic benefits.\nMotilal Oswal highlights the deal as a high-impact event, suggesting it will stimulate Indian market performance both in the immediate term and over a longer horizon. The sectors expected to benefit most include auto ancillaries, defence, consumer products, textiles, electronic manufacturing services, consumer durables, IT services, as well as financial and utility companies.\nThe announcement addresses longstanding uncertainty and negative sentiment. The deal’s resolution lifts a major overhang on investor confidence, which had persisted due to months of stalled negotiations and apprehensions regarding India’s trade leverage with the US.\nOn the macroeconomic side, Motilal Oswal notes: \"multiple positives will accrue in the form of 1) reversal of FII outflows, 2) INR recovering its lost ground, 3) general improvement in sentiments towards Indian equities, 4) return of confidence for FDI, and 5) retracement of India’s underperformance vs. EM peers, etc.\" This reflects the anticipated reversal of adverse trends that have affected Indian equities .\nThe timing of the deal surprised market participants. Motilal Oswal stated: \"In most of our recent investor interactions, we sensed that the majority expected the deal discussions to be protracted, with completion around 2HCY26, ahead of the US midterm elections.\" The earlier-than-expected announcement is expected to improve sentiment and trigger reallocation into Indian equities.\nMotilal Oswal describes the event as a \"structurally 'positive allocation effect'\", indicating a fundamental improvement for India’s long-term market performance. Strained Indo-US relations since April 2024 had contributed to about 40% underperformance against emerging market peers, as well as USD 22 billion of FII withdrawals and a 6% rupee depreciation since January 2025.\nMotilal Oswal adds: \"we believe many of these adverse trends are now likely to reverse.\" The brokerage expects renewed FII flows and rupee stability, improving India’s relative standing among emerging markets.\nThe drop in tariffs means Indian goods move from being among the most heavily taxed imports in the US to some of the least taxed. Only Switzerland, the EU, the UK, Japan, and South Korea offer lower tariffs, but their exports have less overlap with India due to differences in value chain positioning. Major emerging-market competitors such as China, Vietnam, Brazil, Thailand, and South Africa will continue to face higher tariffs, ranging from 19% to 40%.\nThis trade agreement follows the Indo-EU free trade deal signed the previous week, as well as recent deals with the UK, EFTA, Oman, and New Zealand. Motilal Oswal points to these developments as evidence of India’s increasing importance in global trade and strategic relations.\nMotilal Oswal maintains a constructive view on Indian corporate earnings: \"With this deal announcement, we believe that the market will now begin to accord correct weightage to the improving trajectory of corporate earnings growth, which has shown successive improvement over the quarters with an improving earnings revision trend.\" The brokerage also reports: \"We had expected a 16% YoY growth in MOFSL PAT at the start of 3QFY26, and the results to date have been in line with our estimates.\" For Nifty, Motilal Oswal projects: \"We expect ~12% earnings growth for Nifty over FY25-27E.\" Valuations remain below the 10-year average, with 20.4x seen as reasonable in the current context.\nMotilal Oswal has picked Bharat Forge, Balkrishna Tyres, Raymond Lifestyle, Indo Count, Kitex, Welspun Living, Gokaldas Exports, LT Foods, Bluestar, Polycab, KEI Industries, Avalon Tech, Dixon Tech, SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, Waaree Energies, Home First Finance, Aptus Housing and IT companies as key beneficiaries of the trade deal.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

        "full_content": "PB Fintech stock fell around 6% on Tuesday despite the company’s decent performance on key parameters in the December quarter (Q3FY26). Among the positives, revenue rose 37% year-on-year to ₹ 1,771 crore, driven by growth in core online revenue and new initiatives revenue. Insurance premiums jumped 45% and lending disbursals surged 85%. The adjusted Ebitda margin improved to 11% from 6% last year.\nNew protection premiums grew 68% year-on-year, with health insurance alone growing nearly 80%. Protection products are stickier, renew every year, and create a long-term annuity stream. This recurring revenue is one of the biggest drivers of steady profit improvement.\nHowever, negative margins in the new initiatives business was a sore point. New initiatives include PB Partners, which allows insurance agents to sell policies using Policybazaar’s technology; and PB for Business, which offers employee health and group insurance to companies. Two years ago, this segment contributed about 32% of revenue. In Q3FY26, this rose to 41%. More importantly, it accounted for 44% of the incremental revenue growth this quarter.\nRevenue from new initiatives grew 41% year-on-year. Adjusted Ebitda margins for this segment improved from -7% last year to -3% this quarter, and contribution margins turned positive at around 6%. Management indicated that most of these businesses were approaching breakeven, with PB UAE already profitable for four straight quarters.\nPB Partners now works with more than 400,000 advisors and has deep reach in tier 4 and tier 5 towns, aiding scale and fixed cost absorption. Management is upbeat on its insurance growth and expects it to outpace the industry. On margins, the focus is now on operating leverage rather than aggressive cost cuts.\nQIP announcement But most of the positives were overshadowed by the announcement that the company’s board was slated to meet on 5 February to consider raising capital through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) to pursue inorganic growth opportunities abroad. \"With the company already sitting on a more than ₹ 5000 crore cash pile, the requirement of a QIP suggests a large acquisition, potentially resulting in 5-6% dilution,\" JM Financial Institutional Securities. Management has said that the acquisition will be earnings-per-share-accretive. However, JM Financial said it would need to be at a significant valuation discount as Indian markets were unlikely to ascribe PB’s current trading multiple to the international entity. There is also a potential headwind from further rationalization of distribution commissions. Developments related to BIMA Sugam – an aggregator-like platform for insurance sales and related services by insurance regulator IRDAI – should also be monitored. Against this backdrop, the company's valuation at 62 times estimated FY27E earnings per share seems expensive and prices in expectations of extraordinary growth.

The development follows an investigation into investment flows from Little Internet Singapore into the Indian entity, linked to transactions between March 2016 and June 2017. The RBI has imposed a compounding fee of Rs 18.76 lakh in relation to these transactions, which involved an aggregate value of approximately Rs 33 crore.\nIn a regulatory disclosure on Monday, Paytm stated: \"In a stock exchange filing on Monday, the company said the RBI has imposed a compounding fee of Rs 18.76 lakh in connection with certain investments made in Little Internet Private Limited by Little Internet Singapore.\" The company clarified that the order pertains only to the specific historic transactions identified in the RBI review.\nPaytm explained that it is taking the necessary steps to comply with the order: \"Paytm said it is in the process of paying the amount.\" The company further assured stakeholders that the penalty would not have a significant effect on its financial health or day-to-day operations.\n\"The company said the RBI order is not expected to have a material impact on its financials or operations.\" This statement comes as Paytm seeks to maintain stability amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny within the fintech sector.\nPaytm had previously acquired hyperlocal discovery platforms Little Internet and Nearbuy in 2017, merging them into its wider business portfolio. Little Internet was backed by Tiger Global Management and Elevation Capital, while Nearbuy, cofounded by Ankur Warikoo, counted Peak XV Partners as investors. These acquisitions expanded Paytm's offerings and were part of a broader diversification strategy.\nThe compounding order enables Paytm to settle the FEMA contravention by paying the monetary penalty, thereby avoiding further adjudication or prosecution. Authorities often use such orders as an expedient method to resolve technical violations without resorting to protracted legal proceedings.\nPaytm (One 97 Communications Ltd.) posted a profit after tax of ₹225 crore for the quarter ended December 2025, marking a sharp turnaround from a net loss of ₹208 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The year-on-year improvement in profitability stood at ₹433 crore.\nRevenue from operations rose 20% year-on-year to ₹2,194 crore, compared with ₹1,829 crore in the year-ago period. The growth was driven by higher payments gross merchandise value (GMV), a rise in merchant subscription revenues, and increased traction in the distribution of financial services, the company said.\nPaytm’s UPI business continued to gain momentum, with market share expanding for the third consecutive quarter.

Shaadi.com founder and Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal has weighed into the ongoing debate around Gen Z job-hopping, calling out what he describes as “career gurus” for shaming young professionals who switch roles frequently in their early 20s. “Early in our careers, we’re essentially dating industries, roles, and cultures to find what fits,” Mittal wrote, adding that young professionals should not feel guilty about moving on if a role doesn’t align with their interests. “When I’m hiring for senior leadership or Level 1 roles, I almost always reject resumes that don’t show at least one four-to-five-year stint,” he said. Based on his experience as a founder and investor, Mittal outlined a simple career framework -- one should explore aggressively and even switch roles, if needed, and identify what they genuinely enjoy when they are 21-24 years old.

According to him, early career years are meant for discovering passions, testing industries, and understanding workplace cultures.\n“Early in our careers, we’re essentially dating industries, roles, and cultures to find what fits,” Mittal wrote, adding that young professionals should not feel guilty about moving on if a role doesn’t align with their interests.\nHowever, the entrepreneur drew a clear line between early experimentation and long-term inconsistency. Mittal said that while exploration is healthy in the early 20s, prolonged job-hopping later can become a red flag—especially for senior leadership roles.\n“When I’m hiring for senior leadership or Level 1 roles, I almost always reject resumes that don’t show at least one four-to-five-year stint,” he said.\nExplaining his reasoning, Mittal pointed out that the real impact of professional decisions often becomes visible only after several years. “Year one is about learning, year two is execution, and year three is dealing with the consequences of those decisions—and scaling what worked,” he noted.\nBased on his experience as a founder and investor, Mittal outlined a simple career framework -- one should explore aggressively and even switch roles, if needed, and identify what they genuinely enjoy when they are 21-24 years old.\nMittal added that when you are aged 25 and above, you should commit to a company or role worth investing in and build depth over four or more years.\nHe also linked long-term commitment to leadership readiness, stating that aspiring founders and CEOs must demonstrate the ability to stay through challenging phases. “You need to prove you can stay in the kitchen when it gets hot,” he said.\nHe concluded by emphasising that while it may take a year to understand a job, it takes three to five years to truly understand an industry—“and that’s when you really start to win.”\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

What is the reason for that and when can we expect a recovery?A:  We are a business we should be tracked on last twelve months , not quarter-on-quarter, because single licence revenue could be as high as ₹50 crore to ₹100 crore, difference can create a marginal  difference. Where revenue grew 23% on LTM basis, my margin grew 33% on LTM basis, my cash position move 49% year-to-year.Now this is a phenomenal quarter from our internal perspective, quarterly number we cannot manage, and we don't want to manage because the deal size are big, contracts are complex and they cannot be tracked on 90 day period.Q: Since we are not talking about quarterly numbers on of FY26 basis and FY27 basis, now if you have some visibility, what kind of margins are you looking at? In terms of growth as well what kind of deal wins and growth are you looking at?A: If I look at it, our three businesses, which we started, global transaction banking  business is a ₹1,400 crore business, consumer banking  business, we started in 2018 that is close to ₹1,000 crore - ₹960 crore. Our geography distribution is America, which is giving 25% revenue, it will be close to ₹1000 crore with a new deal signing it up, it will further accelerate.Europe is another, 25% revenue comes from there, and rest of 50% comes from Middle East.",

Analyst on the street, who are anticipating a steady state-run rate of over 20% but this time around, it's been quite muted. What is the reason for that and when can we expect a recovery?A:  We are a business we should be tracked on last twelve months , not quarter-on-quarter, because single licence revenue could be as high as ₹50 crore to ₹100 crore, difference can create a marginal  difference. So, margin trajectory should be looked at it from the annualised basis.Last 12 months, we crossed ₹3,000 crore, very significant mark in Indian IT industry, a product company is crossing ₹3,000 crore revenue in last 12 month period. Where revenue grew 23% on LTM basis, my margin grew 33% on LTM basis, my cash position move 49% year-to-year.Now this is a phenomenal quarter from our internal perspective, quarterly number we cannot manage, and we don't want to manage because the deal size are big, contracts are complex and they cannot be tracked on 90 day period.Q: Since we are not talking about quarterly numbers on of FY26 basis and FY27 basis, now if you have some visibility, what kind of margins are you looking at? Will they on a consolidated basis see the 20% mark? In terms of growth as well what kind of deal wins and growth are you looking at?A: If I look at it, our three businesses, which we started, global transaction banking  business is a ₹1,400 crore business, consumer banking  business, we started in 2018 that is close to ₹1,000 crore - ₹960 crore. The AI business, we started in 2021, with the wealth and insurance included, is close to ₹500 crore business. So these three businesses are healthy businesses. Our geography distribution is America, which is giving 25% revenue, it will be close to ₹1000 crore with a new deal signing it up, it will further accelerate.Europe is another, 25% revenue comes from there, and rest of 50% comes from Middle East. And Africa itself gives the ₹600 crore revenue and then India and APAC this is a second lever, which is there. Third is the eMACH.ai. Fourth - what you asked - what opportunities are there for next year is a huge shift in moving from mainframe to cloud business. That is other area where the bigger opportunities are coming in our way. These deals are big in size, so these deals can run into millions of dollar deals. So that's why it takes time to close those deals. AI is a big driver for us.Q: Can you quantify it, so FY27 what is the kind of growth you will end the year with? You know, even if you track it on an LTM basis. And FY27 what kind of growth are you seeing? And can we expect margins to recover back to double digit, or even 20% levels that earlier you used to enjoy? A: We designed the business for 20% growth year-on-year and margins are also about 20%. Now we are in the investment phase, so we move to 25% and come back to 21% so these are the two bandwidth range we designed the business.Intellect Design Arena’s current market capitalisation is ₹11,384.16 crore.

The final winner under the Advanced Multirole Combat Aircraft (AMCA) programme is expected to be selected within the next three months , after the shortlisted companies submit detailed commercial proposals for manufacturing prototypes of the next-generation fighter jets, The Economic Times had reported earlier. The shortlisting was carried out based on parameters such as technical expertise, manufacturing capability, order book position and financial strength. Bidders were required to demonstrate their ability to absorb the AMCA design, along with adequate experience in development, engineering, manufacturing, integration and testing. One of the eligibility criteria also discouraged companies with a large outstanding order book. As per the current plan, the selected company will partner with the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) to build five AMCA prototypes. The defence ministry has earmarked an indicative budget of Rs 15,000 crore for the prototype development phase. The eventual production order, however, is expected to be several times larger once the aircraft is successfully developed and inducted by the Indian Air Force. The AMCA programme is widely regarded as India’s largest-ever military research and development initiative. The fifth-generation fighter jet is expected to form the backbone of the country’s air combat capability from the mid-2030s. An initial batch of 120 aircraft is likely to be ordered, with deliveries projected to begin around 2035.

The company’s net profit also fell 35% YoY to Rs 8.8 crore, from Rs 13.68 crore a year earlier. The company attributed the decline in revenue primarily to the deconsolidation of its esports and events arm, Nodwin Gaming, which was de-subsidiarised last year. In the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, Nodwin had contributed Rs 165 crore to Nazara’s consolidated revenue, which was absent in the current quarter. Despite the YoY decline, the company returned to profitability on a sequential basis, reporting a profit in Q3 after posting a net loss of Rs 34 crore in Q2FY26. The Q2 loss was largely driven by an impairment charge on Nazara’s investment in Moonshine Technologies, the parent of PokerBaazi, following the regulatory ban on real-money gaming. Strong 9MFY26 performance For the nine months ended FY26 (9MFY26), Nazara reported a strong performance, with revenue rising 29.7% year-on-year to Rs 1,431.2 crore, while EBITDA surged 73% YoY to Rs 177.2 crore. The robust growth translated into a marked improvement in profitability, with EBITDA margins expanding to 12.4% during the period. Live Events The company’s flagship kids’ learning app, Kiddopia, saw a long-awaited revival in subscriber growth, supported by Nazara’s Centres of Excellence across user acquisition, data analytics, growth and product development. Nazara also continued to expand its intellectual property (IP) portfolio, including the launch of Animal Jam on Roblox, unlocking new platform-led growth opportunities. Associate company NODWIN Gaming delivered a strong operational performance and remained profitable during the quarter. Management commentary Commenting on the results, Joint Managing Director and CEO Nitish Mittersain said the company continues to make steady progress towards building a global gaming platform. He highlighted disciplined execution, improving operating efficiency and multiple growth drivers across new launches, live content expansion and platform extensions. He also reiterated Nazara’s focus on disciplined capital allocation and strategic acquisitions to drive long-term value creation. Nazara Technologies shares ended Tuesday’s session 1.54% higher at Rs 284.60 on the NSE. The company announced its quarterly earnings after market hours On the technical front, the 14-day RSI stands at 59.6, indicating neutral-to-positive momentum and remaining well below overbought levels.

        "full_content": "Textile stock Gokaldas Exports share price surged over 18%, continuing its sharp upward move on Wednesday, February 4, after a 20% surge in the previous session. The strong rally came as the textile sector emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the newly announced India–US trade deal. It has skyrocketed over 40% in just 2 sessions.\nIndia and the United States have agreed to a trade arrangement under which reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods will be reduced to 18% from 25%. In addition, the extra 25% duty on imports of Russian crude oil will be removed. US President Donald Trump said the agreement would be effective immediately. The development has significantly improved sentiment for textile companies, most of which derive between 50% and 70% of their total revenue from the US market.\nAdding to the positive outlook, the Union Budget announcement on setting up Mega Textile Parks has further strengthened the sector narrative.\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget 2026–27 speech on Sunday, said Mega Textile Parks would be developed in challenge mode with a focus on integrated infrastructure and value addition. The initiative forms part of a broader five-pronged policy framework aimed at boosting India’s employment-intensive textile industry. The proposed parks are expected to attract fresh investment, enhance compliance and traceability, and create integrated hubs that support scale, quality control, and exports.\nGokaldas Exports rose as much as 18.5% intraday to hit a high of ₹ 827. With a 20% jump in the previous session, the stock has surged around 43% in just two trading days.\nOther textile stocks also saw strong moves after confirmation of the India–US trade deal, though intraday performance on Wednesday was mixed. Kitex Garments jumped 14%, while Adhinath Textiles was locked in an upper circuit. Trident gained over 3.5%, KPR Mills traded largely flat, Welspun Living declined more than 6%, Vardhman Textiles slipped over 3%, and Indo Count Industries fell more than 2%.\nIn its Q3 FY26 results, Gokaldas Exports reported a sharp decline in profitability. Consolidated net profit fell 70.97% year-on-year to ₹ 14.61 crore, compared with ₹ 50.34 crore in Q3 FY25. Revenue from operations declined marginally by 0.92% YoY to ₹ 978.65 crore during the quarter.\nThe company said its India operations continued to show resilience, delivering 8% YoY growth despite facing the first full-quarter impact of US tariffs. However, uncertainty around the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and supply chain disruptions weighed on its African business during the period.\nEBITDA declined 18% YoY to ₹ 96 crore, while the EBITDA margin contracted by 202 basis points YoY to 9.7% in Q3 FY26. The company attributed the margin pressure mainly to the impact of US tariff rebates. It noted that productivity improvements, a strong order book, and tighter cost management helped absorb part of the impact.\nMarket experts believe the trade deal could provide a meaningful tailwind for Indian textile exporters, particularly those with high exposure to the US market.\nAnil Rego, Founder and Fund Manager at Right Horizons PMS, said the agreement could materially improve competitiveness for Indian exporters. “For textiles, the impact is particularly significant given the US is one of the largest end markets for Indian apparel and home textiles. Reduced tariffs enhance price competitiveness against peers such as China and Bangladesh, potentially leading to order diversion in India’s favour. Higher volumes, better capacity utilisation, and operating leverage could gradually translate into margin recovery and more stable earnings for exporters,” he said.\nHowever, experts caution that gains may not be uniform across the sector. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVAsset PMS, said the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be companies with strong execution, value-added offerings, and substantial US exposure. He expects export-focused apparel manufacturers to see faster order normalisation as US buyers diversify sourcing away from higher-tariff regions.\nDasani identified Gokaldas Exports, Indo Count Industries, Welspun Living, Pearl Global Industries, and KPR Mills as potential beneficiaries of the shift. “Gokaldas Exports stands out as a direct play on US apparel demand, while Pearl Global Industries offers leverage to garment exports with improving scale. In home textiles, Indo Count Industries and Welspun Living are well positioned given their long-standing US retailer relationships and ability to absorb volume growth,” he said.\nAt the same time, he believes the opportunity is selective, noting that commodity-heavy yarn manufacturers may see limited upside as pricing gains tend to be competed away.\nOops!

Weak cues from the US markets weighed heavily on sentiment, where counterparts of Indian software majors fell sharply amid growing worries that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could intensify competition for traditional software companies.\nInvestor anxiety was sparked after new software updates linked to Anthropic-driven AI models suggested faster innovation cycles and the potential for greater disruption across enterprise software and services. The developments revived fears that AI-led automation and new platforms could squeeze margins for established IT services firms, prompting traders to cut exposure to the sector.\nAt 10.10 am, the Nifty IT index traded at 36,590.80 after falling nearly 6 per cent to 36,297.90 in early trade from the previous close of 38,611.75.\nHeavy selling was visible across frontline counters. Persistent Systems , LTIMindtree , Coforge , Infosys , Tata Consultancy Services, Mphasis and HCL Technologies were among the worst hit stocks, dragging the broader technology index lower. Shares of these companies declined sharply in the opening sessions as institutional investors reacted to the negative global cues.\nHeavyweight Infosys depreciated over 6 per cent to ₹1,551.20 against the previous close of ₹1,656. TCS also fell 6 per cent to ₹3,031.20.\nMarket participants said the fall reflected both near-term nervousness over pricing power in IT services and concerns that clients in developed markets could reassess technology spending in an environment of rapidly evolving AI capabilities.\nThe sharp drop in US-listed tech stocks overnight further amplified risk-off sentiment at home, leading to a broad-based sell-off across IT names.

Anthropic’s launch of workplace productivity tools intensified worries, with the sector shedding approximately $300 billion in market value, Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research, HDFC Securities, said.\nFor now, volatility is expected to remain elevated as markets digest the implications of new AI-driven products and their potential impact on traditional software and outsourcing models.\nPublished on  February 4, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

        "full_content": "IT stocks came under intense pressure in early trade on Wednesday, with the Nifty IT index plunging more than 5 per cent, tracking a steep sell-off in global technology shares. Weak cues from the US markets weighed heavily on sentiment, where counterparts of Indian software majors fell sharply amid growing worries that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could intensify competition for traditional software companies.\nInvestor anxiety was sparked after new software updates linked to Anthropic-driven AI models suggested faster innovation cycles and the potential for greater disruption across enterprise software and services. The developments revived fears that AI-led automation and new platforms could squeeze margins for established IT services firms, prompting traders to cut exposure to the sector.\nAt 10.10 am, the Nifty IT index traded at 36,590.80 after falling nearly 6 per cent to 36,297.90 in early trade from the previous close of 38,611.75.\nHeavy selling was visible across frontline counters. Persistent Systems , LTIMindtree , Coforge , Infosys , Tata Consultancy Services, Mphasis and HCL Technologies were among the worst hit stocks, dragging the broader technology index lower. Shares of these companies declined sharply in the opening sessions as institutional investors reacted to the negative global cues.\nHeavyweight Infosys depreciated over 6 per cent to ₹1,551.20 against the previous close of ₹1,656. TCS also fell 6 per cent to ₹3,031.20.\nMarket participants said the fall reflected both near-term nervousness over pricing power in IT services and concerns that clients in developed markets could reassess technology spending in an environment of rapidly evolving AI capabilities.\nThe sharp drop in US-listed tech stocks overnight further amplified risk-off sentiment at home, leading to a broad-based sell-off across IT names. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.4 per cent as software stocks extended losses. Anthropic’s launch of workplace productivity tools intensified worries, with the sector shedding approximately $300 billion in market value, Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research, HDFC Securities, said.\nFor now, volatility is expected to remain elevated as markets digest the implications of new AI-driven products and their potential impact on traditional software and outsourcing models.\nPublished on  February 4, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

        "full_content": "The sharp global sell-off in software stocks has set off fresh anxiety around Indian IT services, with investors beginning to worry that artificial intelligence could start eating into future growth. But experts differ on how quickly that pressure will show up in numbers.Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner at Geosphere Capital Management, believes the market is looking past current earnings and focusing on how business models might change. “People have now started worrying about different segments, and IT services is the latest one to get this concern,” he said. In his view, the sell-off reflects deeper unease about where value will sit in a more AI-driven tech stack. “This is about concern about future growth, future value.”Sanger does not see this as a short-term earnings problem. “This may not be a one-year call, but this is a two-, three-, four-year. There’s real headwinds emerging that could be very meaningful,” he said. The fear, he explained, is that if AI agents can take over more routine and process-driven tasks, demand for traditional services work could come under pressure. “At some point, people are realising that even the software services companies are going to suffer.”He also questioned whether Indian IT services valuations adequately reflect this risk. With the sector trading at around 20 times earnings for 7–8% growth, Sanger asked, “What happens if that earnings growth disappears in a couple of years?” arguing that markets are underpricing the possibility of AI-led disruption to the core services model.Worries around Indian IT services picked up after a sharp overnight sell-off in US software stocks spilled over into Indian names, erasing significant market value early in the session.The trigger was rising concern that AI tools are shifting from assistance to direct automation, especially after Anthropic expanded its Claude agent with plug-ins for legal work, document review, compliance and enterprise workflows.

Guidance looked better than expected,” he noted.Katri agreed that AI disruption is a serious theme but said the numbers have not yet shown broad damage. “Ultimately, the proof is going to be in the numbers,” he said. For now, he sees companies adjusting through “reskilling and repositioning their models.”On Indian IT specifically, Katri said the sector could still play an important role in the next phase of AI adoption, especially in integration and data preparation. “We do believe that there’s going to be a spending cycle that focuses on integration and data,” he said. “The sector is very well positioned from the infrastructure side of AI, massaging the data, preparing it to basically get fed into those accelerators.” At the same time, he added that “it’s going to take some time until those projects really gain traction.”He linked the sector’s prolonged underperformance largely to sentiment. “The underperformance continues to be a function of sentiment,” he said, adding that “the next 12 months will probably be better than the last 12 months.”Also Read: See 40-70% upside in Indian IT stocks as sector nears business cycle turn: Motilal Oswal's Abhishek PathakFor the entire discussion, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

The deal, announced jointly by US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reduces reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports to 18%. Following a 20% gain on Tuesday, the stock extended its rally on Wednesday, climbing another 20% intraday to hit Rs 832.85 on the NSE. Under the new agreement, Indian exports to the US will face an 18% tariff, which is lower than other major garment-exporting countries, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, where tariffs remain at 20%. Overall, US tariffs on Indian goods will be cut from 50% to 18%, while India has agreed to reduce its tariff and non-tariff barriers on US products to zero. The textile sector has been particularly sensitive to US trade policies, as most Indian textile exporters earn 50–70% of their revenue from the US market. For Gokaldas Exports, the US accounts for nearly 70% of total revenue, making the company a major beneficiary of the deal. The recent stock rally marks a significant turnaround for Gokaldas Exports. Over the past year, the stock had declined about 14%, but over the past three years, it has delivered substantial gains of 136%, doubling investor wealth. Live Events From a valuation perspective, Gokaldas Exports currently trades at a PE ratio of 43.44 and a PB ratio of 2.38, indicating relatively high investor expectations. Gokaldas Exports reported quarterly revenue of Rs 998 crore for Dec-2025, reflecting a slight decline of 0.3% year-on-year. The company’s net profit for the quarter stood at Rs 15 crore, marking a sharp drop of 71% YoY. In terms of shareholding, both Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and Mutual Funds (MFs) increased their stakes during the December quarter. FIIs raised their holdings from 22.93% to 23.71%, while Mutual Funds increased their stake from 34.24% to 35.03%. From a technical perspective, Gokaldas Exports remains bullish. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 57.3, suggesting the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, the stock is trading above 7 of 8 key Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating strong upward momentum.

        "full_content": "Concept Debut: Bentley has unveiled the Bentayga X Concept, an off-road-focused version of the Bentayga Speed. The vehicle previews a possible production SUV designed with stronger off-road ability. Bentley says the concept was created to collect public and customer feedback on a Bentayga with greater capability beyond standard road use. Powertrain Base: The concept keeps the Bentayga Speed’s 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 petrol engine producing 650 PS, or about 641 bhp. Power is sent to all four wheels through a permanent all-wheel-drive system and an eight-speed automatic gearbox. The air suspension and the 48-volt active anti-roll control system are also retained. Chassis Changes: Mechanical revisions centre on ground clearance and stability. Ride height is raised by 55 mm, increasing ground clearance to about 310 mm. Track width is expanded by 120 mm to improve balance on uneven ground. The wheel arches are extended outward by 40 mm to accommodate the wider stance. Off-road Hardware: The SUV uses forged 22-inch single-piece wheels from Brixton with high-profile all-terrain tyres. These changes increase water-wading depth to more than 550 mm. The revised dimensions move the Bentayga X Concept closer to the measurements typical of purpose-built off-road vehicles. Exterior Updates: The Bentayga’s main body shape is retained, but several functional changes are visible. The lower front bumper, wheel arches, side skirts and rear splitter receive a black finish. The front bumper includes twin towing points. A roof rack is fitted, carrying four auxiliary spotlights intended to support driving in low-visibility environments. Exhaust System: At the rear, the concept features a titanium sports exhaust developed by Akrapovič. The system is designed to handle demanding use while preserving performance characteristics from the Bentayga Speed. This modification supports the vehicle’s shift toward multi-surface driving rather than road-only use. Event Debut: The Bentayga X Concept debuted at the FAT Ice Race in Zell am See, Austria. The winter event combines motorsport and car culture and marks the beginning of a multi-year partnership between Bentley and FAT International. Skijoring Display: During the event, automotive presenter Chris Harris drove a Bentayga in a Skijöring demonstration, towing Norwegian freestyle skier Hedvig Wessel. The activity demonstrated vehicle control and traction on ice, aligning with the concept’s focus on operation in low-grip conditions. Segment Trend: Bentley’s study follows similar moves by other performance brands. Examples include the Porsche 911 Dakar and the Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato, both adapted for rougher surfaces. These models show demand for high-performance vehicles that can operate beyond paved roads while keeping their core engineering layouts. Production Outlook: Bentley has not confirmed production of the X Concept. The company states the vehicle was developed to measure interest in a more off-road-capable Bentayga. Feedback gathered from the public and customers will guide future decisions on whether such a version should join the existing Bentayga range.",

However, Ebitda growth of 10 per cent YoY for the quarter fell short of Street expectations, largely due to an adverse pricing mix in India and softer domestic margins.

While the management is cautiously optimistic about delivering double-digit volume growth in India on a weak base and maintaining margins, aided by capacity additions at new plants and distribution expansion, ICICI Securities sees risks.\n\"International business performance remained strong with 10 per cent YoY volume growth, and is expected to benefit further from portfolio expansion (snacks portfolio, Carlsberg beer distribution) and Twizza acquisition (in Q2CY26).

The stock’s technical structure remains constructive, with prices holding above key long-term averages despite recent consolidation. This suggests the broader uptrend is still intact.”\nHe further noted that the power and renewable energy sector continues to perform well, supported by policy focus, rising capacity additions, and improving order visibility.\nOn the fundamentals, Suzlon has shown steady improvement in revenues, margins, and balance-sheet strength over recent quarters. “The market will now focus on execution consistency, order inflows, and cash-flow stability. If the company sustains its current operating performance, it should reinforce confidence that the turnaround is durable, keeping the medium-term outlook positive,” Rathod added.\nDuring its recent manufacturing day in December, the management reiterated confidence in a strong order book and a healthy order inflow outlook, with equipment yet to be awarded for around 18 GW of under-development capacity.

        "full_content": "Shares of Mankind Pharma Ltd dropped more than 4 per cent during the trading session on Wednesday after the company reported a sub-par performance in the December 2025 quarter. Results on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis came in weak and analysts have mixed views on the counter.\nBrokerages believe that Mankind Pharma is seeing steady gains in chronic therapies but muted overall growth due to weakness in acute segments and integration challenges. It is working to revive acute growth, scale up the BSV acquisition and improve productivity, while managing near-term margin and earnings pressure from debt-funded expansion.\nShares of Mankind Pharma dropped 4.45 per cent to Rs 2,060 on Wednesday, with its market capitalization slipping below Rs 86,000 crore. The stock had settled at Rs 2,155.90 in the previous trading session. Shares of Mankind Pharma have plunged nearly 25 per cent from its 52-week high at Rs 2,726.75 hit in July 2025.\nShares of Mankind Pharma were listed at the bourses in April 2023, when the company raised a total of Rs 4,326 crore from investors by selling its shares for Rs 1,080 apeice. The stock has gained more than 90 per cent from its IPO price so far.\nMankind Pharma reported a 9.5 per cent jump in the net profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis to Rs 414 crore, while revenue jumped 11.5 per cent YoY to Rs 3,567 crore for the three months ended on December 31, 2025. The company reported a 4.6 per cent YoY jump in the adjusted ebitda to 923 crore with ebitda margins contracting 170 basis points to 25.9 per cent.\nDomestic revenue registered a growth of 11.1 per cent YoY driven by growth in base business, further aided by BSV consolidation, while consumer healthcare revenue rose 5.2 per cent YoY, regaining sequential growth momentum. Exports revenue increased 14 per cent YoY primarily driven by healthy growth in BSV international business.\nConsistently maintained first rank over the last 8 years with prescription share of 15.2 per cent, said the company in its release. It clocked healthy growth in secondary sales for Gas-o-fast, Manforce Condom and Ova news of 33 per cent, 8 per cent and 36 per cent YoY respectively in Q3FY26.\nMankind not only increased the chronic share but also grew in line with industry in chronic therapies (excluding GLP1 launches). However, total secondary sales growth was muted due to an inferior show in acute therapies as the company implemented coarse corrective measures, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd .\nMankind is working on multiple fronts gaining market share in chronic therapies, reviving growth in acute therapies, integrating and building synergy from BSV acquisition, and d) revising business policy for consumer health business. The pick-up in growth from these corrective actions remains the key monitorable,\" it added with a 'buy' tag and a target price of Rs 2,505.\nOrganic India formulation growth was at 9.1% YoY, and exports grew in mid-single-digit, and BSV recorded sales of Rs 464 crore (India + Export). Mankind is on track to launch Semaglutide in India after patent expiry. While the BSV acquisition will be EBITDA-accretive, the debt-funded M&A could keep near-term earnings stressed, said HDFC Securities.\nMankind expects gradual recovery in the acute therapies after corrective measures to ensure the volume growth and productivity improvement; strong growth in key chronic segments led by traction in recently launched products; BSV: scale-up over next few quarters, targets to improve margin in the near term; and expand the presence in export markets, it said.\nFactoring Q3 miss, we have cut EPS estimates for FY26/27 to factor lower-than-expected margin and delay in synergies with BSV. We maintain 'add' with revised target price to Rs 2,460,\" HDFC Securities said.  \"We keep monitoring the progress in BSV business integration as well as growth momentum and debt repayment.\"\nNirmal Bang Institutional Equities sees revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 13 per cent/12 per cent/8 per cent over FY25–FY28E, factoring in a slower-than-anticipated recovery in the base business, delayed productivity normalization and lingering GST-related disruptions. Ebitda margins are expected to remain broadly stable at 24 per cent as operating efficiencies and product mix gains offset higher employee costs and R&D spend.\n\"Field-force productivity, especially in Tier 2–4 markets, remains a key monitorable as ramp-up of newly-recruited MRs is taking longer than expected. We estimate a healthy cumulative free cash flow generation of Rs 6,270 cror over FY26E–FY27E, most of which will likely be used for debt repayment. ROE/ROCE are expected to moderate by FY27E,\" it said with a 'hold' rating and target price of Rs 2,177.\nMankind’s revenue was in line with estimates, while Ebitda was slightly above but net earnings were below estimates due to one-off items. Organic domestic branded formulation growth remains subdued owing to integration / execution challenges, said Systematix Institutional Equities.\n\"The anti infective / acute business is also a drag on overall growth. Company reduced net debt by Rs.5000mn during the quarter (Net Debt to Ebitda at 1.3 times). We tweak our forecasts as we lower our expectations on domestic formulation growth. We roll over our price target to FY28E EPS and maintain 'hold' on Mankind Pharma with a revised target price of Rs 2,467,\" it adds.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

On that date, the Infosys stock slipped as much as 9.4 per cent to touch an intraday low of Rs 1,304.24 on BSE before eventually settling 8.18 per cent lower at Rs 1,322.94 apiece against its May 20, 2023, close of Rs 1,440.72. This eroded significant investor wealth, as the Infosys market capitalisation plunged by over Rs 54,000 crore, bringing its total market cap down to Rs 6.31 lakh crore, BSE data showed. And there is concern in the market that it will eat into the core business of data and information services firms,” said Mayuresh Joshi, Head of Equity Research at William O Neil India. The BSE IT index was down 6.21 per cent to 34,844.43\nThe effect was felt overnight in the US markets, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq index dropped 1.43 per cent to close at 23,255.19.",
        "full_content": "Shares of the Indian IT sector saw a steep decline on Wednesday, with heavyweights such as Infosys and TCS taking a massive hit following concerns about Anthropic's new offerings. Infosys, India's second-largest IT firm, plunged over 8 per cent, marking its steepest decline in over two years and six months.\nAt 12:22 pm, shares of Infosys plunged 8.23 per cent to trade at Rs 1518.80 on the BSE, a sharp drop against its previous close of Rs 1,654.95. This marks the most steepest single-day fall for Infosys since May 21, 2023. On that date, the Infosys stock slipped as much as 9.4 per cent to touch an intraday low of Rs 1,304.24 on BSE before eventually settling 8.18 per cent lower at Rs 1,322.94 apiece against its May 20, 2023, close of Rs 1,440.72.\nThis eroded significant investor wealth, as the Infosys market capitalisation plunged by over Rs 54,000 crore, bringing its total market cap down to Rs 6.31 lakh crore, BSE data showed. “I think what has really transpired late last night is that Anthropic has probably developed some sort of new AI automation tool. And there is concern in the market that it will eat into the core business of data and information services firms,” said Mayuresh Joshi, Head of Equity Research at William O Neil India.\nOther IT major shares also plunged. TCS was down 6.50 per cent to Rs 3,014 apiece, while Tech Mahindra dropped 5.79 per cent to trade at Rs 1,616.35.\nThe BSE IT index was down 6.21 per cent to 34,844.43\nThe effect was felt overnight in the US markets, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq index dropped 1.43 per cent to close at 23,255.19. “So I believe data processing firms, which make up a sizable portion of the Indian IT ecosystem, will be impacted. But it's not just IT stocks. Look at what happened to US stocks overnight. Atlassian, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Gartner, and Accenture stocks were all significantly lower,” Joshi said.\nAnthropic recently launched plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent, a move designed to automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing, and data analysis functions.\nWhile these plug-ins work across various use cases, they are reportedly powerful in tailoring Anthropic’s Claude to specific job functions such as sales, legal and financial analysis.\nVK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, noted that the rally fuelled by the US-India trade deal will face hurdles to sustain.\n\"The IT selloff in the US yesterday will drag the Indian IT index, too, constraining the rally in the Indian market. Since valuations continue to be high there is no fundamental support for a sustained rally,\" Vijayakumar added.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today.

        "full_content": "Hero MotoCorp is expected to post a healthy performance in the December quarter, aided by strong festive demand, an improved product mix and price hikes, even as market share pressures persist in some segments. Based on an average of six brokerage estimates, the company’s revenue is projected to rise about 19% year-on-year in Q3, while profit after tax is seen increasing 17% year-on-year. Sequential growth is expected to be more modest, reflecting a stabilising operating environment following the festive-season boost. Volumes are likely to be the key driver this quarter. Most analysts expect volume growth in the mid-teens, aided by festive demand and recovery in rural markets. HSBC expects overall volumes to be flat quarter-on-quarter but higher by around 16% on a YoY basis. Kotak Equities also builds in 16% YoY volume growth, driven by strong festive trends. Pricing and product mix are expected to offer incremental support. HSBC notes that discounts were flat sequentially, while the company took a price hike of about 50 basis points during the quarter. Kotak expects average selling prices to rise 2–2.5% YoY, helped by a richer mix, including a higher share of exports and scooters. Motilal Oswal adds that discounts were lower during the festive season and that the company implemented a sharp 10% price hike on electric vehicles from early December, which should aid realisations. Live Events On margins, expectations are largely stable to mildly positive. HSBC expects EBITDA margin to remain flat quarter-on-quarter at around 15%, as benefits from pricing and volumes are offset by competitive pressures. Motilal Oswal also expects margins to remain broadly stable QoQ, with operating leverage benefits likely to be neutralised by higher input costs, especially precious metals, and increased advertising spends. Kotak Equities is slightly more optimistic, expecting EBITDA margin to expand by about 60 basis points YoY to 15.1%, driven by operating leverage from higher volumes. Nuvama also expects margin expansion on a YoY basis, supported by better scale and mix. Segment-wise, some pressure points remain. HSBC highlights a sequential decline in the economy segment market share by about 70 basis points and a sharper 110 basis points drop in scooters. However, the brokerage points to sustained recovery in the entry-level motorcycle segment and flags the upcoming Splendor 125cc launch as an important trigger to watch. Electric vehicles remain an area of focus. HSBC notes a supply ramp-up in Vida, Hero’s EV brand, while Motilal Oswal factors in the recent price hike in EVs as margin-positive, albeit with near-term volume sensitivity. From an earnings perspective, healthy volumes are expected to translate into steady profit growth. Motilal Oswal expects PAT growth of about 13% YoY, slightly below the street average, reflecting its conservative margin assumptions. Overall consensus, however, points to mid-to-high teens profit growth. Looking ahead, analysts say commentary on demand outlook, rural recovery trends, and the launch timeline for new models, particularly in the 125cc category, will be closely watched.

That's the whole business.”Management said the recent rise in debt is largely linked to execution of new projects and refinancing of operational assets, rather than any stress on the balance sheet. Net debt remains at a comfortable level for a utility business, supported by long-term power purchase agreements  and predictable cash flows.In October-December quarter  ACME Solar Holdings reported revenue of ₹496 crore, and profit after tax at ₹113 crore and margins at 89.5%.While tariffs for plain battery projects have seen pressure recently, ACME Solar has largely stayed away from those bids. The company has focused on hybrid and round-the-clock projects, where tariffs are locked in at the time of winning bids and remain stable for 25 years.Management said the average tariff for upcoming capacity is higher than the existing portfolio average. In addition, higher capacity utilisation factors are expected to lift revenue per megawatt.Operating margins are also expected to stay strong, given the fixed-cost nature of the business. EBITDA margins have remained around 90% over the past few quarters, reflecting the stability of the model.With capacity additions planned in phases, the full financial benefit will flow through gradually as projects get commissioned. However, the long-term visibility remains strong due to fixed tariffs, long-duration PPAs, and limited variable costs.Watch accompanying video for moreCatch all the stock market live updates hereFollow our live blog for more updates on Q3 results",

However, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation  declined 2.3% to ₹367.6 crore from ₹376 crore, reflecting pressure on profitability.The operating profit margin softened to 25.5% from 27.7% a year ago, while profit after tax fell 10% to ₹244 crore, compared with ₹271 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The company’s market capitalisation currently stands at about ₹18,283.93 crore, and its shares have declined close to 2% over the past one year.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: The parent deal has now been announced. Historically, Stonepeak has delisted companies it has acquired, and that is one reason why, immediately after the announcement, the market began speculating that a similar move could happen at Castrol India as well. There is still uncertainty around this, but have you heard anything about what changes could follow from this transaction?A: Let me first address our Q4 numbers, and then I will respond to your question.First of all, I am very pleased to say that it has been the eighth straight quarter of volume growth, and volume growth ahead of the market, which has resulted in share gain. This has come on the back of us as a company executing the strategy that we had signalled earlier.We are building our business in terms of reach into rural India in a big way. We are scaling up our industrial business, and we have had a lot of product innovations that we have introduced throughout the year, which have enabled the core business to grow. And we are quite pleased with the results that we have seen at the end of the year.You are right in terms of EBITDA margin. We had signalled that EBITDA would be in the range of 21% to 24%. We actually came ahead of that. We are up beyond 25%. There are some one-time charges in Q4. But overall, I would like to reassure you that the Q4 operating parameters of the business remain very strong — a strong balance sheet, very strong cash flow, which allows us as a business to respond to the environment very proactively.The Stonepeak announcement has happened. It's a deal that is subject to closure, which has various regulatory things that will happen as and when it closes. I think, as a shareholder, they would announce whatever is next on the cards. But in the business, at Castrol India, we remain focused on executing our strategy, which is to go big into rural, scale up the industrial business, and we are also seeding in our services business.Q: Have you heard any kind of inkling whether or not there will be some action for the Indian entity? There's always that buzz, right? I have heard it for many, many years, actually, but now there is this fresh news that's come in.A: We are not involved in those conversations as an operating team; we are focused on our business.Q: So, let's focus on business then. Volume growth was close to around 8%. For this year, what kind of volume growth are you looking at? And also, if you could help us out with how much contribution comes in from electric vehicle  fluid sales. How much is it and where is it headed?A: To talk about volume growth, one has to look at the perspective of the market. We estimate that the market is slated to grow anywhere between 3.5% and 4.5%. What we aim for is to grow the volume-driven topline of this business, at 1.5-2x of the market, and through that, therefore, gain share. And we are doing that by going deep into rural India, because different parts of the country are growing at different rates. Different segments are growing at different rates.Also Read: Copper to lead the next base metals cycle as electric vehicle demand rises: Dhan founderOur strategy is focused on tapping into those opportunities and building the business to track growth as the market opens up. So that's what we are doing.To your second question, EVs are a growing part of the business, but small. But we are positioned to take advantage as and when the market expands. In two-wheelers, for example, it's around 10% of new sales that are EVs. In cars, it's less than that. But we have good partnerships with most of the original equipment manufacturers , and we have products in the market which are ready to be distributed as and when there's demand for that.Q: The industrial segment, you said that that's about 12% to 15% of your business, and you expect it to grow over a period of time. If you could give us a sense of what sort of targets you have earmarked for the industrial business.A: The industrial business grew double-digit last year, and that contributed to that 8% growth. We maintain that kind of guidance, which will be ahead of the average growth rate of the market. And because it's a small part of our business, it will grow much faster than the core business.We are focused on executing a strategy which is about growing into segments such as aerospace, cement and steel, where typically we have been underrepresented. And we have a team which is today going around the country today, introducing Castrol to customers in this segment, because that is what Castrol has not traditionally been associated with, and we have seen success on that front.Q: Do you think the industrial business grows two times of your core growth, which itself will be 1.5-2x of the industry growth?A: That is the kind of range that the industrial business has been delivering, and I expect the industrial business to sustain that level of growth.Q: You have also indicated that you are developing products for the data centre business. Are you in talks with hyperscalers and other big clients globally as well? Give us some colour on this.A: Yes, we are in talks, and some of these are global accounts. As you can imagine, hyperscalers are businesses that set up data centres across the world, and there are trials that are happening in India, and the trials are happening in different parts of the world.We are also putting innovation into those products and working through what would be the next cycle of products that will be launched into the market. So very much engaged — again, a small part of our business and a small opportunity today, but positioning us for growth into the future.Also Read: Castrol India eyes 21-24% margin band as rural and industrial segments pick upQ: From a data centre standpoint, what proportion of their bill of materials  would be the product that you sell? We just want to understand, because by and large, the opportunity is huge. Everyone talks about that, but what kind of value chain benefit would accrue to players like you?A: Early days to estimate that, because the technology itself is evolving quite a bit, and there are different kinds of cooling technologies in play. Their core business is not about manufacturing and producing something. So, it's about serving the requirement of removing heat so that the data centres operate at a high degree of efficiency, and we have products which enable that particular outcome.Watch the interview in the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

        "full_content": "(representative image)\nThe easing of rare-earth supply is expected to drive electric two-wheeler volume growth in India to 16-18 per cent next fiscal after moderating to 12-13 per cent in the ongoing fiscal due to supply chain constraints, according to Crisil Ratings.\nThis fiscal, the electric two-wheeler (E2W) growth is expected to moderate due to temporary disruptions in the supply of rare-earth magnets and the goods and services tax (GST) rationalisation on internal combustion engine (ICE) models, Crisil Ratings said in a statement.\nIn the previous fiscal, E2W volume growth was at 22 per cent, it added.\n“The supply disruption caused by the shortage of rare-earth magnets had weighed on E2W volumes around mid-year. As availability began to ease, coinciding with the GST-led price revision in ICE models, OEMs relied on discounting and introduced lower-priced electric models to narrow the ICE-EV price gap,” Crisil Ratings Senior Director Anuj Sethi said.\nWhile this has supported a recovery in volumes in recent months, the impact of the earlier supply disruption is expected to limit full-year growth to 12-13 per cent, he added.\n“With supply conditions improving, reflecting a gradual resumption of inflow of magnets from China alongside initial steps by OEMs to diversify sourcing, growth is expected to re-accelerate to 16-18 per cent next fiscal, assuming stable availability of rare-earth magnets,\" Sethi said.\nCrisil Ratings said the expected growth of 16-18 per cent is supported by a structural ownership-cost advantage. However, competitive pressure is creating divergent risk profiles, with legacy players better insulated, while new-age players continue to face weak unit-vehicle economics.\n“An analysis of 10 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), comprising four legacy players with ICE and E2W portfolios and six new-age, EV-only players, indicates as much,\" it said, adding these OEMs account for about 85 per cent of the E2W volume.\nE2W adoption continues to be supported by strong vehicle economics. While GST rate cuts have reduced the purchase cost of ICE vehicles, running costs favour E2Ws, at about 3 paisa/km versus ₹2-2.5/km for ICE, continuing their advantage in total cost of ownership even as subsidies taper, it said.\nWith incentives being phased out and the pace of decline in battery cost (which accounts for 35-40 per cent of total costs) slowing after a sharp correction over the past two fiscals, Crisil Ratings said price-led competition has narrowed.\nIncreasingly, reliability and service are becoming more important differentiators, and this is where legacy OEMs are scoring high at present, it added.\n“The market share of legacy players has increased to 62 per cent by January 2026 from 47 per cent a year earlier, clearly outperforming new-age players,\" Crisil Ratings Director, Poonam Upadhyay, said.\nThe share gain reflects their stronger dealer reach and supplier ecosystems, alongside an expanded range of entry-level and mid-priced electric models that enable faster rollout, wider availability, and more consistent execution, Upadhyay noted.\nPublished on  February 4, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

The current level is about 23 to 24%.Q: Lastly, could you talk to us about the strategy behind the foray into the commercial mobility segment?A: I think this is a very interesting segment, and we have seen the segment really grow, especially post COVID, in the last three to four years, when people are looking for shared mobility.",
        "full_content": "Hyundai Motor India plans to increase exports as part of its long-term production strategy, according to Managing Director and CEO Tarun Garg. The company is focusing on using its existing manufacturing capacity to support both domestic and export demand.Hyundai plans to increase the share of exports in total production over the next few years. Garg said exports currently contribute about 23–24% of total production. He said, “we intend to go to 30%.” The company has set this as a long-term target for the fiscal year 2029-30 .The company currently has total production capacity of about 994,000 units across its plants. He said the company has about 824,000 units of capacity in Chennai and about 170,000 units in Pune.He said exports have remained a key part of Hyundai’s India operations since it entered the country. He said the company continues to be the largest exporter among auto manufacturers in India on a cumulative basis. He said, “exports have been a great driver.”Hyundai Motor India reported single-digit growth in revenue and operating profit on a year-on-year basis for the October–December 2025 quarter. The company continues to focus on balancing domestic sales and exports to support growth.The company currently has a market capitalisation of ₹1,78,954.05 crore. Its shares have gained more than 18% over the last year.These are the edited excerpts of the interview.Q: In January, the volumes rose to close to 12%, with the highest ever monthly sales. Could you tell us how quarter four is shaping up so far?A: I think it's a very positive sign. And we can see positive momentum everywhere. Thanks to goods and services tax  2.0, we saw in the October to December quarter also a lot of retail momentum. And what happened was because we were able to make space in the network inventory, January also started on a very positive note, and we are seeing growth across segments.For example, Aura clocked the highest ever sales. The new Venue has received a great response, almost 80,000 bookings and highest ever sales again, Creta continues to be very strong, so I think we can be much more positive about quarter four. I don't like to put a number to it, but as things stand now, the momentum seems to be very strong.Q: Most brokerages have raised their passenger vehicle  industry outlook, especially post the recent volume upmove that has happened. What's your own estimate for the industry? Not particularly for you. What's your own estimate for FY27?A: In fact, now we are already at the end of FY26, and it's better to talk about even FY27, and we had a Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers  conclave where all the auto original equipment manufacturers  were present, and the consensus was about 5 to 6% growth for the industry. I'm sure Hyundai would like to beat that.Also Read | Bajaj Auto sees export run-rate holding above 2 lakh units a monthAnd like I said, the calendar year has started on a very positive note. And we believe that, because the growth is everywhere, and the maximum growth is coming in the compact SUV segment, where the new Venue has received a great response, and we are looking at avenues to increase the production further, because we have a great backlog of orders. So, we can sustain this kind of momentum going forward in FY26–27 also. And as we already announced in the investor day, our new model has already kicked in with the Venue, and more models will come in. I think all that should help us to carry this momentum to the next fiscal.Q: You reported an increase in realisation of around 3%. I assume you've taken a price hike. If you could give us some clarity on that particular aspect.A: If you see the last quarter, in January 2025 we had a price increase of about 0.7%, and obviously that effect has helped until December - October to December quarter. And obviously we had some very strong cost optimisation measures. We have a very strong quality of growth strategy. Even post GST, we were very disciplined in our discount levels, which remained less than 3%.So, all in all, all these factors have helped us to have growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation  margins and growth in topline as well as in bottom line. Exports also helped. We had a 21% growth in exports last quarter on a year-on-year  basis. And I think exports continue to be a very strong pillar in HMI’s quest for volume and profitability.Q: Since you spoke about profitability, let's talk about the margins. Will it stay around this 11.2–11.3% sort of band despite commodity inflation?A: During our Investor Day, we have already given guidance that our EBITDA margins will stay between 11% and 14%, and we are fairly confident of meeting those expectations going forward as well.Q: Is there another price hike on the anvil?A: Ideally, we don't want to do price hikes, and we always try to do cost optimisation. So, we'll watch the commodity prices, we'll see what the pressures are, and we'll take a decision as and when required. But obviously, the endeavour is always to avoid price hikes as much as possible, to do cost optimisation and other measures in terms of saving cost or localisation or the trim strategy, the quality of sales strategy. So, I think that will continue to be our endeavour going forward as well, unless it becomes imperative to pass on some of the cost to the customers. But let's see.We will watch the commodity prices. The volatility is so high. You have seen how things are moving, especially precious metals. So, I think we need to have a close watch on that.Q: Exports have been a growth driver, and you briefly mentioned them in the past. Could you tell us what's the strategy with regard to exports from here on?A: We have headroom because of the additional capacity in the Pune plant. So, we have accelerated on the exports. We are Hyundai Motor Company’s  hub outside of Korea for the emerging markets. The new Venue is produced exclusively in India. This will present some new opportunities for us. The Middle East is doing very well in exports, Latin America as well. The new model cycle is kicking in. So we look at those models also helping us in exports.In the mid-term, all these FTAs are also very exciting, and we still need to go through the details — India-EU, whether there is any opportunity there. So, we'll be very open and positive. The demographics of India, a very strong plant structure, and a very high level of quality put us in a very good position to continuously look for opportunities for increasing exports.Also Read | PG Electroplast holds FY26 target, waits for channel inventory to clear, summer salesHyundai has been very strong in India in terms of exporting since the time we set foot in India. On a cumulative basis, we still hold the position of being the number one exporter. And in the last 12 to 15 months, exports have been a great driver. Already, we have announced that from the current level of 23 to 24% contribution of exports to overall production, we intend to go to 30%. So, the plans are very much intact, and we are fairly confident that exports will only go up from here.Q: Since you spoke about increased capacity helping your exports, could you tell us what your current capacity utilisation is, and when do you get to this 30% contribution coming in from exports?A: The current capacity is now almost 824,000 in Chennai and 170,000 in Pune. So, 994,000 is our capacity. So, we have enough capacity now. And that 30% is, of course, for FY30. So that is a long-term plan. The current level is about 23 to 24%.Q: Lastly, could you talk to us about the strategy behind the foray into the commercial mobility segment?A: I think this is a very interesting segment, and we have seen the segment really grow, especially post COVID, in the last three to four years, when people are looking for shared mobility. So, I think Hyundai is a strong brand and has very strong products, along with the factory-fitted CNG option, both in the hatchback as well as in the sedan segment. So, we've introduced it in January. The initial response is very encouraging, especially in the sedan segment. That has helped us clock the highest ever Aura sales.And overall, the products are very reliable. We have a very comprehensive strategy. It's not only about the product. Our dealers are ready. We are tying up with financiers. The service packages are there to give comfort to the operators. So, we are fairly confident that we will be able to make a strong mark in this segment, where the competition is not very strong and very few players have the right product to tap this taxi segment.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation  is fairly strong, but a large part of that has to do with the deconsolidation of the sports business and some of the acquisitions that you've made over the course of the last year as well. So organically, excluding all the acquisitions and deconsolidation, on a like-to-like basis, what has been the revenue and profitability growth for you?A: So, revenue growth is 10%. Profitability growth would be upwards of 25%. But just to take a step back, the revenue decline at the headline number is typically because of the deconsolidation. Our focus on core gaming continues to progress very well. And our EBITDA margins in this quarter have increased significantly to 16.8%. So, we're very much on the right track. We are executing what we said we would execute, and the numbers are tracking what we expect.Q: One of the positives was with regard to Kiddopia and the resumption of subscriptions and subscribers. There were many quarters where we saw a decline, and now that's picked up. What's the outlook from here on? Does this addition continue? And would you say the worst is behind for the Kiddopia business?A: Fundamentally, since last year, we have created these centres of excellence in user acquisition, in data analytics, in artificial intelligence  and product. What the centres of excellence are doing is supporting each of our games and our studios to enhance the way they are operating. And the first positive impact, and tangible impact, you can see is in Kiddopia.We were struggling to add to the subscriber base for quite some time, and this quarter we've been able to show a net positive impact. And the best part is that our cost per acquisition has come down from $37 to $35.4, so we've been able to spend more but at lower costs, which makes us feel that we can get growth going strongly in the coming quarters.Also Read | A made-in-India global gaming powerhouse: CEO Nitish Mittersain's ambition for NazaraQ: In terms of the investments that you're making in the business so far, what has been the total dollar value of investments that you've made in the company so far, and will you be making more? Are you looking at some sort of shareholder fundraising?A: We are continuing to invest, one, organically in our existing businesses. That is very important. If you see any of our games, like Animal Jam has been launched on Roblox.We've signed new licences for TV shows globally. We recently launched a Big Brother game. There's a lot of investment that's going into existing business, and we are also actively pursuing new acquisitions of gaming studios, and continue to be in advanced talks with a few, so that may happen. I think we will continue with these new centres of excellence that we have created. A good part of that is that they will support all these studios that we acquire and add a lot of synergy and value to them.Q: The dollar value of total investments that you've made in the company so far — because organic growth is at around 10% — one sense is that you'll be raising funds for funding growth going forward. So, you will be using shareholders' money to buy growth. That's the point here. So, if you could give us the dollar value of the investment.A: Over many years, we would have invested a lot of capital. But in the last year, we did two key acquisitions — Fusebox Games and WildWorks. Between the two, we invested capital of about ₹500 crore or less. Currently, the company has about ₹700 crore worth of net cash on its balance sheet. And if we require additional capital, we will raise capital.What we are very focused on is to ensure that if there is any capital raise and there is dilution to the shareholders, the accretion in terms of cash flows from the businesses that we acquire is far more rewarding than the dilution. So, we are very conscious of that. The one metric we are looking at is cash flow per share. It should be significantly improved by any action that we take.Q: And if you're doing a dilution, what could it be to the tune of? Will it be ₹500 crore, ₹800 crore, or ₹1,000 crore kind of dilution?A: If we do, perhaps in that range. But there is nothing final at this point in time.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

The growth in every sector related to GCCs, as well as if you look at now, even with the Budget, with the AI and the data centre companies, and this solutioning that is going to provide tax holidays is only going to help and improve the sector.Q: You have 152,000 seats, when do we expect this number to double from here?A: So last year, we added about 40,000 seats. So, 32,000 for this year, next year, we will provide that guidance in the next quarter itself.Q: Since you said you are at the highest level of commercial rentals, even volumes and pricing are going in tandem, so I wanted to understand, what would the risk to some of the big opportunities that there are in the industry currently? So, the growth engines and the drivers for co-working, overall, for commercial real estate, are very strong.For co-working, it's a first port of call, especially for the first time GCCs, they do not have their teams in India, and as a result, co-working and flex provides a great solutioning. But I think there is a very clear approach that we are taking where we have to balance the seat addition with the growth and the profitability at the same time.If you look at our numbers, we did about ₹22 crores of PAT at this point, and for the year or nine month period, we are almost ₹50 crores of PAT.",

Also, now if you have more clarity on FY27 as well, because we are almost done with FY26 what kind of seat additions, revenue growth and margin outlook are you looking at?A: The guidance for FY26 continues to remain what we had given originally about a 30% growth for the overall business. As you see in the nine month period, the co-working and allied services grew much faster, at about almost 38% and for the quarter as well, it grew at about 32% so continuing to see great growth momentum in our co-working business.Also, for FY27 at this point, I would not like to comment. We will give that guidance in the quarter four results, because we are still planning our annual operating plan there. The sector overall seems extremely bullish. The growth in every sector related to GCCs, as well as if you look at now, even with the Budget, with the AI and the data centre companies, and this solutioning that is going to provide tax holidays is only going to help and improve the sector.Q: You have 152,000 seats, when do we expect this number to double from here?A: So last year, we added about 40,000 seats. This year, our seat addition is about 32,000 and that's specifically because, we are at the highest cycle of the commercial real estate in terms of rentals, so we have been a bit cautious about it. Again, our growth targets remain the same, but we were a bit cautious. So, 32,000 for this year, next year, we will provide that guidance in the next quarter itself.Q: Since you said you are at the highest level of commercial rentals, even volumes and pricing are going in tandem, so I wanted to understand, what would the risk to some of the big opportunities that there are in the industry currently? Would it be pricing decline? Would it be volume decline? How are you seeing the industry shape up going forward since we have seen a big surge already?A: The industry bases a lot of things that have gone in the macro environment, the trade deal happened, the budget was very supportive of foreign investments coming in the GCC boom. I mean, if you look at the GCCs, there are about 2,900 GCCs every quarter. We are adding 25 to 30 new GCCs. Projection is by 2030 we would have close to about 4,500 GCCs employing 2.8 million people from 1.5 million today. So, the growth engines and the drivers for co-working, overall, for commercial real estate, are very strong.For co-working, it's a first port of call, especially for the first time GCCs, they do not have their teams in India, and as a result, co-working and flex provides a great solutioning. Today, we have been able to do 12 GCCs, first time GCCs, 11 more on pipeline. If you look at the overall revenue, 21% of our revenue comes from GCCs, which is about 80 plus companies in our portfolio today. So, very bullish overall, for the sector and as well as for our own growthQ: If you can tell us, how long does it take for a new centre to breakeven? And considering that, 32,000 to 40,000 on an annual basis, do you think next three years we can look at three lakh seats for Awfis?A: We would want to obviously grow in that direction. But I think there is a very clear approach that we are taking where we have to balance the seat addition with the growth and the profitability at the same time.If you look at our numbers, we did about ₹22 crores of PAT at this point, and for the year or nine month period, we are almost ₹50 crores of PAT. For us, balancing the two decent amount of growth, 25-30% while balancing seat addition is very critical. If you look at our even today's seats that we have added, it's enough for us to demonstrate 25 to 30% growth through FY27. Exact guidance we will give, but today we still have seat capacity to fill, which will allow us to grow at that pace.Catch all the stock market live updates hereFollow our live blog for more updates on Q3 results",

The India-US trade deal took a positive step, with the US reducing the tariff on India’s exports to 18 per cent and doing away with the penal tariff of 25 per cent, said Kotak Institutional Equities, with expecting markets to react positively with some near-term appreciation bias for the Indian rupee on the back of positive sentiments and flows. While details are awaited, reports suggest that India will have to remove their tariff and non-tariff barriers, commit to more imports from the US in addition to the current levels and stop buying Russian crude oil,\" it added. Ventura Securities has picked Gokaldas Exports, Welspun Living, Indo Count Industries, KPR Mills, Trident, Arvind, Vardhman Textiles, Bharat Forge, Samvardhana Motherson International, Sona Comstar, Sundaram Finance, Balkrishna Industries, JK Tyres, Avanti Feeds, Apex Frozen Waterbase, Sky Gold, Vaibhav Global, Goldiam International as key beneficiaries of the trade deal .

        "full_content": "India's recent tariff relief from the United States (US) has strengthened the country's role in global exports, closely following the finalisation of the European trade agreement. The India-US trade deal is expected to drive substantial growth for Indian exports, especially in sectors like textiles, apparel, and electronics, as Ventura Securities highlights.\nThe dual agreements—described as \"the India-EU Free Trade Agreement (the Mother of all deals) and the India-US Trade Deal (the 'Father of all deals')—have fundamentally altered India's trade structure. For sectors with high export dependence, such as textiles, chemicals, and auto ancillaries, the changes signal immediate margin improvements and long-term opportunities.\nThe India-US trade deal took a positive step, with the US reducing the tariff on India’s exports to 18 per cent and doing away with the penal tariff of 25 per cent, said Kotak Institutional Equities, with expecting markets to react positively with some near-term appreciation bias for the Indian rupee on the back of positive sentiments and flows.\nWhile details are awaited, reports suggest that India will have to remove their tariff and non-tariff barriers, commit to more imports from the US in addition to the current levels and stop buying Russian crude oil,\" it added. \"Indian producers or tariff rates are relatively low, though some risks remain for auto parts, iron/steel, plastics and chemicals.\"\nAccording to Ventura Securities, this development brings a competitive 18% reciprocal tariff with the US—which effectively scraps the 25% 'Russian oil penalty'—and achieving zero duty access for 99% of exports to the EU. This positions India as a favoured alternative to Chinese and Southeast Asian supply chains.\nVentura Securities notes that most key players are already operating at 75–90% capacity utilisation, and with reduced trade barriers, the industry is likely to enter a significant 'Brownfield' expansion phase. Export-dependent companies are expected to benefit most from tariff relief, particularly those with substantial US market exposure.\nMajor competitors remain leading Chinese and Southeast Asian firms, but the new deals may shift the competitive landscape in favour of Indian producers. Ventura Securities observes that the current environment is set for substantial expansion across export-driven segments, as regulatory changes and improved market access begin to influence company strategies and sector returns.\nVentura Securities has picked Gokaldas Exports, Welspun Living, Indo Count Industries, KPR Mills, Trident, Arvind, Vardhman Textiles, Bharat Forge, Samvardhana Motherson International, Sona Comstar, Sundaram Finance, Balkrishna Industries, JK Tyres, Avanti Feeds, Apex Frozen Waterbase, Sky Gold, Vaibhav Global, Goldiam International as key beneficiaries of the trade deal .\nIt also sees Aarti Industries, Vinati Organics, SRF, Navin Fluorine, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, PI Industries, Mirza International, Mayur Uniquoters, Superhouse and Bhartiya International as other key beneficiaries . All these companies have up to 90 per cent experts to the US or European nations.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today. India Today Group.",

Live Events -- YES Securities pegs the net loss at Rs 2,208 crore weighed down by sharp YoY decline in JLR earnings. -- JM Financial is the most cautious, forecasting net losses of Rs 4,549 crore. -- Deven Choksey Research is the only brokerage among the four which estimates TMPV to report a profit, albeit 18% lower on YoY basis at Rs 446 crore. 2) Revenues -- Nuvama estimates consolidated revenues at Rs 69,023 crore, down 27% YoY and 5% QoQ, as JLR production disruptions offset robust India PV growth. -- YES Securities sees revenue at Rs 68,447 crore, down 5.4% QoQ, with a steep YoY decline driven by JLR. -- JM Financial expects revenues of Rs 67,094 crore, down 29% YoY and 8.3% QoQ. -- Deven Choksey Research pegs PV revenues at Rs 10,218 crore, down 9.3% YoY and 41.2% QoQ. 3) EBITDA Nuvama forecasts EBITDA of just Rs 374 crore, down 97% YoY, citing higher variable marketing expenses (VME) and lower operating leverage at JLR. -- YES Securities estimates EBITDA at Rs 1,490 crore, with partial recovery in margins QoQ. -- JM Financial expects EBITDA losses of Rs 794 crore, reflecting continued stress at JLR. -- Deven Choksey Research estimates PV EBITDA at Rs 1,174 crore, down 5.4% YoY. 4) EBITDA margin -- Nuvama expects EBITDA margin to compress sharply to 0.5%, down 1,275 bps YoY and 248 bps QoQ, led by weak JLR scale and higher costs. -- YES Securities sees consolidated EBITDA margins recovering modestly to around 2.2%, though still well below historical levels due to JLR headwinds. 5) Volume Deven Choksey Research estimates PV volumes at 3,60,472 units, up 6% YoY and a sharp 71.2% QoQ, supported by festive demand, GST 2.0-led revival and launches such as the Sierra. 6) Key monitorables JLR demand and production outlook post the cyber-attack disruption remains key monitorables, said both Nuvama and JM Financial. Meanwhile, margin recovery trajectory at JLR, including the pace of volume ramp-up and VME normalization also remain in focus, opines YES Securities.

Aggressive bidding by smaller players in Green Ammonia, Hydrogen, and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) auctions has led to prices considered unsustainable for profitable execution.\nDiscussions with Advait Energy and JSW Energy indicated that several government tenders, including the latest, are unlikely to be feasible for bidders under current conditions. On the BESS front, standalone tariffs have dropped sharply from about Rs 280,000 per MW per month in early 2025 to around Rs 150,000 per MW per month recently. This rapid decline may cause delays as power purchasers reconsider previously contracted prices in light of lower tariffs.\nB&K Securities noted the risk of a 'winner’s curse' and cautioned that these aggressive tariff levels could ultimately result in losses for developers unable to deliver profitably.\nAnother issue raised is the backlog of around 42 GW of solar Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that remain unsigned, largely due to last-mile evacuation delays. The figure represents a cumulative build-up over years, mainly caused by delays in commissioning central transmission utility substations needed to connect projects to the main grid.\nTenders for renewable generation and grid substations are often awarded separately, and any delay in substation commissioning leads to cost overruns. Developers may have to rely on higher-cost state transmission networks, costs that distribution companies are unwilling to bear.

Grid stability and resilience will become an important theme in the coming decade This should be positive for Siemens Energy, GEV T&D and Hitachi Energy,\" B&K Securities adds.\nSuzlon Energy Suzlon Energy is India’s largest wind turbine OEM and is positioned to benefit from the country’s accelerating wind energy deployment. The company reiterated that renewable energy is essential for India’s long-term self-sufficiency, and wind remains a structurally important pillar given India’s resource abundance.\nThe S144 turbine platform has been designed specifically to generate electricity efficiently even in low-wind zones, expanding the addressable market. The company expects installations to reach ~1,500 units in FY27, implying a strong growth ramp-up. Suzlon believes that larger MW turbines will drive further technological improvement by enhancing efficiency and addressing land-scarcity constraints.\nWaaree Clean Energy Solutions Waaree is expanding into the green hydrogen ecosystem through electrolyser manufacturing, positioning itself early in an emerging decarbonization value chain. It believes green hydrogen adoption is still at a nascent stage, although hydrogen remains a fundamental input across industrial processes.\nThe company expects green hydrogen economics to converge toward parity with grey hydrogen over the next few years, enabling broader adoption. Waaree has entered into a technology tie-up with a Chinese partner and is currently focused on manufacturing alkaline electrolysers, given their inherent cost advantage over PEM systems.\nSiemens Energy India Siemens Energy India is a critical supplier of FACTS systems and grid-stabilisation technologies that will become increasingly essential as renewable penetration rises. STATCOM demand is currently concentrated in the Gujarat-Rajasthan renewable corridor. Management estimates that every 1 GW of renewable addition requires roughly 300 MVAr of STATCOM capacity to stabilise grid operations.\nPraj Industries Praj Industries is expanding from ethanol into renewable chemicals, bioplastics and SAF technology licencing. It demonstrated Poly-lactic acid (PLA) technology through a 100 tpa lactic acid plant and is offering this as a licensable solution. Balrampur Chini Mills is the first large-scale customer, licencing Praj’s technology for ~55 tpa lactic acid production.\nTorrent Electricals Torrent Electricals is scaling rapidly in the HV/EHV cable segment, supported by structural transmission capex tailwinds. The company is venturing aggressively into HV and EHV cables and is already gaining market share in these categories. Cables remain a scale-driven business, where margins are largely determined by raw material procurement discipline and operating leverage.\nReNew Energy Global ReNew is among India’s largest renewable IPPs with a diversified operating portfolio across solar, wind and hydro. It is increasingly scaling its upstream manufacturing presence to strengthen integration and reduce import dependence. It currently operates 11 GW of renewable capacity and has another 8-9 GW under-construction, providing strong multi-year growth visibility.\nThyssenkrupp Industries India Thyssenkrupp is a leading provider of industrial boiler systems in India, offering full EPC solutions across large-scale thermal and process applications. It primarily focuses on industrial boilers ranging from 50 TPH to 1,000 TPH, with demand coming largely from industrial processes and chemical industries.\nSolar Turbines Solar Turbines is a global leader in mid-sized industrial gas turbines, with strong relevance in distributed energy and industrial captive power applications. It manufactures gas turbines in the 1-35 MW range and holds a leading global market position in this segment. Management indicated that the US remains the primary market for Solar Turbines.\nAdvait Energy Advait Energy is participating in early-stage green hydrogen tenders, though economics remain immature and pricing highly competitive.

And specifically, in unsecured, how much headroom do you have, given some of the asset quality pressures that lenders have been telling us seem to have abated?A: We have always concentrated more on the secured front, starting with the MSMEs, commercial trading, and we added secured retail, particularly housing loans, loan against the property , rental discounting and all.So, from 2024 onwards, we have started building up the team, and around the end of the calendar year , we were able to see growth improving. And we have not gone in a significant way, unsecured retail, so far, and that strategy will stay for many more quarters to come before, if at all, we see on that line.Also Read: Budget 2026 | PSU bank mergers, capital rule changes on the table as India aims for bigger global banks: DFS SecretaryBut as of now, we are going purely on secured lending on MSMEs, commercial trading, gold loans and agriculture, along with now the secured retail of, let’s say, housing loans, LAP and other things.So, we feel we are spending some time on setting up the team. So, could you give us a sense of margins, based on all these factors?A: As you rightly said, we started fixed-rate gold loans a year before last, and the entire gold loan portfolio has, by and large, converted into a fixed-rate portfolio already. As we discussed in the con-call, over the next two to three quarters, whatever term deposits are maturing and repricing at lower rates, we will get the benefit to compensate for whatever yield reduction is happening on the asset side because of the repo cut.So overall, we are confident that whatever margin we currently have is sustainable, with a plus or minus 10 basis points.Q: The credit-deposit  ratio is at 86%, are you comfortable with that and your guidance for what kind of deposit growth would you have?A: The deposit growth will definitely be in tune with the credit growth, so that there will not be any stoppage in credit because of the non-availability of deposits.",

And we never had a concept of a sales team in our bank in the past. It’s only in the last couple of years that we have been verticalising these business lines, and the sales units and all are now set, and they have started delivering.In fact, we said a year before last that last year it would make a loss. And for 2025-26 , it would start breaking even. And then from next year onwards, it would start adding to profitability. In fact, it has started adding to profitability this year, slightly ahead of whatever we had.Q: Margins were a key positive in this result as well. How much of that is sustainable, because part of it is because of your gold loans being made fixed-rate? How much repricing is left? And even deposit repricing is something you have done. So, could you give us a sense of margins, based on all these factors?A: As you rightly said, we started fixed-rate gold loans a year before last, and the entire gold loan portfolio has, by and large, converted into a fixed-rate portfolio already. So, we do not expect any shock.At the same time, the repo rate cut pass-through happened only towards the end of the quarter. So, the impact because of that will be slightly higher in terms of reduction in yields on advances.Also Read: Chola Securities backs PSU banks, cautious on private lenders and midcap cementAt the same time, it will get compensated. As we discussed in the con-call, over the next two to three quarters, whatever term deposits are maturing and repricing at lower rates, we will get the benefit to compensate for whatever yield reduction is happening on the asset side because of the repo cut.So overall, we are confident that whatever margin we currently have is sustainable, with a plus or minus 10 basis points.Q: The credit-deposit  ratio is at 86%, are you comfortable with that and your guidance for what kind of deposit growth would you have?A: The deposit growth will definitely be in tune with the credit growth, so that there will not be any stoppage in credit because of the non-availability of deposits. Consistently, we have maintained that we are comfortable with a CD ratio of about 85% to 86%, and we are in that range currently.Watch the interview in the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

Sinha said, “Exact launch dates are not yet known.” He said the company is working to bring launches forward where possible.Mahindra Lifespace has guided for residential pre-sales of about ₹4,500 to ₹5,000 crore in the next financial year. The company said early launches will help support sales momentum. Sinha said, “We’ve given guidance of ₹4,500 to ₹5,000 crore for our pre-sales.”The company reported its earnings for the October–December 2025 quarter, supported by a recovery in residential sales and demand in its industrial and integrated cities business.Mahindra Lifespace currently has a market capitalisation of ₹7,970.49 crore. The company’s shares have declined by more than 1% over the past year.These are the edited excerpts of the interview.Q: There's an increase in quarter three bookings and volumes as well. But if I look at the nine-month sales, they have come in at ₹1,773 crore. FY25 sales were at ₹2,800 crore. Do you think you'll be able to surpass last year's bookings, considering that the quarterly run rate so far has been around ₹500 crore?A: We will be able to surpass our last year's numbers and hopefully show growth. Some part of that is driven by the launches. We had, as an example, a very successful launch of a project called Mahindra Blossom in Whitefield, Bengaluru, and in the three days of the last weekend, it did more than ₹1,000 crore itself. So, we are hoping to see growth driven by some of these launches. So, one of them is Mahindra Blossom.Also Read | Hyundai Motor India plans to lift exports share to 30% of production by FY30We are expecting a couple of other launches to come through, but more importantly, for the launches that we did in the early part of the year, as well as the phase launches of the previous projects, which will give us growth momentum. We see opportunities across all our markets — Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Pune. And these launches are just evidence to show that there is momentum in the market for our kind of products, for our value proposition.Q: Could you quantify these launch numbers for us? And how much in Q4, and how much would come in FY27?A: We are looking at maybe two to three big launches coming in the next three months, and I'm not constraining it by the end of the financial year, because sometimes launches spill over the March 31 deadline. But we have roughly anywhere from ₹7,000 to ₹8,000 crore worth of launches that are going to happen towards the end of quarter four and the start of quarter one.Combining some of that — exact dates and exact launch dates are not yet known. We are pushing hard to get them sooner, but this is very important, because for the next year, I've given guidance of ₹4,500 to ₹5,000 crore for our pre-sales on the residential side, and that's something that we are looking forward to by having these launches lined up in the early part of the next financial year. Hopefully, some of the quarter four launches will have a positive effect on the pre-sales velocity next year.Q: The big talking point, of course, has to be demand trends. The realty index is coming off the 52-week high. Many stocks are at lows as well. Do you think we are towards the latter part of the real estate upcycle?A: I wish I knew the perfect answer to that. But let me give you three points here. The first point is that there are some signs of moderation in the market, especially in certain segments and certain micro markets or specific cities. For example, in NCR, we see a significant slowdown. We see a slowdown in the luxury segment. There are markets that have this characteristic.But overall, if you look at inventory overhang — how much inventory is there in the market that customers can buy — it has moved up only 10%, from 13 months to now close to 15 months. That means if no new launches are coming into the market, all the inventory that is there will get absorbed in 15 months. It was 13 months two years back. So, it hasn't been a very significant shift on the inventory overhang side, but there are certain pockets and segments where you see a slowdown.Also Read | Nazara Technologies says core business improving, more acquisitions on radarThe second is that we need to be clear where we play, and it's good that we are present in Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru.The third part is, as things slow down — and we expect some part of it to happen and then get corrected over a longer period — there is a shift towards branded developers, and quality developers who have a multi-year track record, who have always met customer expectations, and delivered projects on time in line with expectations.
