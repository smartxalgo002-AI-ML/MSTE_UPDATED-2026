In 2024 Indian refiners imported an average of about 70,000 barrels per day from Venezuela with shipments exceeding 150,000 bpd in two months according to Kpler shipping data. “Venezuelan crudes are heavy and sour and therefore cheaper and would be of interest to Indian refiners many of whom can process these types of crudes,” said Prashant Vasisht Senior Vice President and Co Group Head Corporate Ratings at ICRA Ltd .

India has not received a single cargo of Venezuelan crude since May 2025 but Trump’s remarks have raised expectations of a resumption of trade. In 2024 Indian refiners imported an average of about 70,000 barrels per day from Venezuela with shipments exceeding 150,000 bpd in two months according to Kpler shipping data. “Venezuelan crudes are heavy and sour and therefore cheaper and would be of interest to Indian refiners many of whom can process these types of crudes,” said Prashant Vasisht Senior Vice President and Co Group Head Corporate Ratings at ICRA Ltd . Reliance Industries’ refineries can process the extremely heavy and sour crude positioning the conglomerate as a direct beneficiary of any Venezuelan oil resumption. Minimal impact from Russian crude exit Vasisht noted that for the Indian refining sector there are ample avenues including the US to purchase crude as Russian crude accounted for less than 2% of Indian crude imports prior to FY2023. Live Events Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 discounted Russian crude flooded the Indian market. Venezuelan oil dropped out of India’s import basket last year but Trump’s latest signal could pave the way for its return as a meaningful supply source. Iranian barrels that once accounted for about 10% of India’s crude imports were replaced by supplies from the US and other producers after 2019 demonstrating India’s ability to swiftly reconfigure its crude sourcing strategy. While the Indian side has not commented officially Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil and to buy much more from the United States and potentially Venezuela. The development plays directly into Reliance Industries’ refining capabilities and cost structure. RIL shares have been under pressure amid uncertainty around Russian and Venezuela imports and are still down around 8% this calendar year so far. Its Q3 results which were also impacted by lower than expected performance in the retail business amid a slowdown in discretionary consumer spending offered investors little to chew on.

It said GAIL’s ability to defend gas marketing margins amid rising gas costs and a recovery in transmission volumes underpins its positive stance, while noting that petrochemical profitability remained a drag during the quarter.\nMotilal Oswal reiterated its buy at target price of ₹190, projecting a 19 per cent compound annual growth in profit over FY26–28. The brokerage expects this to be driven by higher gas transmission volumes, improved performance in the petrochemical business as new capacity comes on stream and spreads recover, and healthy profitability in the trading segment. It also forecast return on equity stabilising above 12.5 per cent and strong free cash flow generation over the period.\nNuvama Institutional Equities, however, struck a cautious note, highlighting delays in tariff hikes and a prolonged downcycle in petrochemicals. The brokerage said GAIL’s Q3 EBITDA missed consensus expectations mainly because of weaker petchem earnings, while transmission volumes were flat year on year. It cut its FY27 and FY28 estimates and maintained a reduce rating with a target price of ₹151.\nPublished on  February 3, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

Emkay Global raised its volume estimate to factor in the strong ramp up via the EL platform (built in ASP moderation) and believe that Ather can achieve Ebitda and PAT breakeven in H2FY27. The stock rose 12.88 per cent to hit a high of Rs 684.85.\nDuring the quarter, Ather Energy sold 67,851 units, captured a national market share of 18.8 per cent, and improved Ebitda margin by 1,600 basis points (bps) year-on-year (YoY) to minus 3 per cent. Losses continued to shrink, with Ebitda loss down to Rs 29.9 crore, and the quarterly loss narrowing by 45 per cent compared to Q2FY26.\nNomura said store expansion, and launch of the “EL” platform in FY27E should be key growth drivers.

The company said exports crossed six lakh units during the current quarter and expects record export revenue in dollar terms in the fiscal year 2025-26 .“Quarter four will sustain at the levels,” Sharma said adding that the company's exports are growing at about 15 to 18%.For 2026-27 , export growth will depend on global demand and market conditions. Sharma said the company will respond to market trends quarter by quarter, adding that international business is influenced by multiple factors including global economics and geopolitical trends.Bajaj Auto recently reported results for the October-December 2025 quarter, supported by growth across domestic, export and electric vehicle segments. Profit was slightly below market expectations during the quarter.The company currently has a market capitalisation of ₹2.71 lakh crore, and its shares have gained more than 8% over the past one year.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: Give us your overarching view on the India-US trade deal. I know predominantly you cater more to Latin America and Africa, so your exports to North America are fairly limited. But how does it change the industry? And as it is under Section 232, broadly, what have you picked up?A: It's certainly welcome news. Quantitatively for Bajaj Auto exports to the US, which we do under the Triumph and KTM brands accounts for about a percentage of our total exports. So even when the tariffs went up, we were, on an overall basis, not impacted by it. So now, when the tariffs are down, the same sort of holds.Also Read | US-India trade deal removes tariff overhang, clears air for investors: Nisha BiswalHowever, having said that, as we build up our business with KTM Austria, and through them, accessing markets like the US, we do foresee more and more production shifting into India, and therefore, we will be making more US-relevant products in the future. And having these tariffs will certainly be very helpful from that point of view.And beyond that, the signal, which goes out from a sentiment point of view with the US and India aligning, there are so many other things, we trade in US dollars there, and so it's good to have this positive sentiment all around. It's good for trade.Q: Monthly exports on the whole, you're crossing the two-lakh mark. So, this quarter, it's been in excess of six lakh. And you've also said that the company expects exports to deliver the highest-ever top-line performance in dollar terms in FY26. How do you see the export momentum, particularly for Q4? Does the two-lakh momentum get stronger per month? And for FY27, do you have a number in mind?A: I think Q4 will sustain at the levels which we have been doing. We've been growing at about 15 to 18%. Q4 tends to be a bit shorter, because we tend to complete our exports by March 20 or so. So, you have, in that respect, fewer days. But the tempo should be maintained, and we are hoping to, on average, still clock over 200,000 units per month as an average in Q4.Going beyond that, we are going to be responding to the market quarter by quarter. At this point as things are now, it looks as if we will be sort of trying to inch up above this number in FY27, but international businesses have several moving parts, microeconomics, geopolitics, etc., so it's very difficult to crystal-ball gaze. But at this point in time, we would be looking forward to maintaining this kind of tempo, even in FY27.Q: What about margins? If you could talk about the commodity inflation that you have seen in Q3, expectations for Q4, and even in terms of offsetting measures via price hikes.A: So the margin story is not a very difficult one at this point in time. Yes, there has been an increase in the noble metals package, quite substantial increases, but they have been offset by flattish performance of steel and rubber and some natural products. So, on balance, from the commodity side, there has been a little bit of inflation, which we have taken action on early January to plough those back.Now, as we move forward, the softness in the Indian rupee has been very helpful, and with the rupee trading at 90 plus to the dollar, that is a very significant tailwind. So, we're not under any kind of great pressure to manage the margin story, given these things. So, we will always be looking at competition and the impact on demand, etc., and responding to those factors, rather than the cost side factors.Also Read | India–US trade deal: Auto stocks gain up to 20% led by Balkrishna IndustriesQ: Baseline margins of 20% plus should sustain.A: Hopefully.Q: And the EV markets— you have pulled back a good amount of market share, close to around 500 basis points. Do you believe you can go even higher from here? And your earlier competitor, Ola, is struggling out there. Have you had a look at their business?A: All the time. Because you know that we had a major supply chain dislocation in two-wheelers and three-wheelers, and therefore, quarter three, clawing back five percentage points of market share and getting back to a firm number two after having slipped down the league table is welcome. And almost in the closing period of quarter three, we also launched a new edition, which sort of opens up a new segment for the Chetak scooter.The Chetak C 25 is targeted specifically at youth and women. And that should open up opportunities, so the Chetak portfolio has been bolstered, and we will therefore obviously be looking forward to improving our market share in quarter four. Electric three wheelers also — we had slipped out, but there, the return has been quite rapid, and we are, for the last two months now, at the number one position. I think in January, we've exited at about 38% market share in the E-auto segment.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

An early onset of summer in southern India and a healthy order book underpin the company’s confidence of meeting its full-year guidance, even as January demand remained soft due to excess stocking in December.In October-December quarter , PG Electroplast reported revenue of ₹ 1,412 crore, profit after tax ₹60 crore and margins at 8.30%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: Is there a possibility that you can out beat this guidance - 17 to 19% revenue growth and the PAT number from ₹300 crores for FY26?A: I would like to stick to the revenue guidance that we have given of ₹5,800 crore. Is that correct?A: Yes.Q: This time was a room air conditioning  business, but I understand there was an account of the energy changes which come in, and there was a channel filling so going forward in quarter four or first half of FY27 which is also sort of the peak market for you, what kind of growth should we expect for the RAC business?A: I would look at quarter three, where the brands were picking up lot of inventory because of the price increase in the models of different air conditioners based on the rating energy table change. So that led to the good growth of AC sales in our quarter three numbers, and December was one of the best sales months for us, for air conditioners.We feel going forward in in in the quarter four of FY26 we are seeing that the inventory is still there in the channel, and that inventory still needs to be picked up. We remain optimistic based on the guidance and the based of the order book that we have with us from our clients.Q: What's the update on the compressor JV, we have been talking about that in the past, but what is the latest?A: I would say the compressor thing is still moving, and we are hopeful that we should be able to close in next, I would say, three to four weeks.",

Vikas Gupta, Managing Director of PG Electroplast is confident about a demand recovery after a volatile first half of the year.The December quarter marked a sharp turnaround, with revenues rising over 45% year-on-year, driven largely by a strong rebound in the room air-conditioner  segment following aggressive channel stocking ahead of the January 2026 energy rating transition.While Q3 benefited from pre-buying by brands, management indicated that elevated inventory levels across the channel could weigh on near-term volumes.The focus in the coming weeks will be on inventory normalisation and the pace of secondary sales as the summer season approaches.

We need to see how the next three to four weeks will look out. January month was a little tough because there was a lot of inventory which was already build-up in the month of December. We are hopeful that the going period of next six to eight weeks would be better for us.Q: PAT will be around ₹300 crores by the end of this year. Is that correct?A: Yes.Q: This time was a room air conditioning  business, but I understand there was an account of the energy changes which come in, and there was a channel filling so going forward in quarter four or first half of FY27 which is also sort of the peak market for you, what kind of growth should we expect for the RAC business?A: I would look at quarter three, where the brands were picking up lot of inventory because of the price increase in the models of different air conditioners based on the rating energy table change. So that led to the good growth of AC sales in our quarter three numbers, and December was one of the best sales months for us, for air conditioners.We feel going forward in in in the quarter four of FY26 we are seeing that the inventory is still there in the channel, and that inventory still needs to be picked up. We are just hoping that the summer onset should start in Southern India in next two or three weeks, we are doing our own channel checks, and still the market has not opened up. We remain confident and that that market should open up and we should be able to meet the sales guidance that we have given for our company. We remain optimistic based on the guidance and the based of the order book that we have with us from our clients.Q: What's the update on the compressor JV, we have been talking about that in the past, but what is the latest?A: I would say the compressor thing is still moving, and we are hopeful that we should be able to close in next, I would say, three to four weeks. We are hopeful, and it is still work in progress. There is a positive moment on that, and let us hope that we should be able to close it in next three to four weeks.Q: Just give us a sense about inventory, because you mentioned that a couple of times that inventory is still high in the system. Could you tell us what is the norm and in number of days, what is it currently?A: Inventory, we need to look at two different levels. One is the inventory at our company level and the inventory in the channel with the trade partners. So, when you look at the inventory at our level, and the normalised level of inventory in the peak season should not be more than 30 to 40 days. And still, we are sitting at almost around 45 to 50 days inventory, which we are expecting that should get normalised in month of February and March.Regarding the channel inventory, yes, there has been lot of push of the inventory by all the brands to the channel partners, before the change of the energy table. So, there is an inventory sitting in the channel, and we are just hoping that it gets cleared with the secondary sales picking up in the coming two, three weeks.Q: Just a quick word on commodity price inflation, because for room ACs copper is a big one. We have seen this in previous cycles, it doesn't hurt and then suddenly starts to gross margins, etc, start to come under pressure. Your thoughts?A: Definitely the commodity prices are playing lot of pressure on the bill of material cost, and we are in active discussion with all of our clients for the price increases. In some cases, we have been able to achieve the price increase. In some cases, still under discussion. Definitely, there is always a lag. Whenever there is a price increase coming in, there is a lag, and we are in discussion, so it might put some pressure on the EBITDA margin for which we have already guided. If you look at the EBITDA guidance that we have given for FY26 is slightly lower than the EBITDA that we were able to achieve in FY25. So, we are hopeful that we should be able to get the price increase done with most of the clients.The prices that we settle with our clients are mostly on the monthly and the quarterly basis.Q: What was the impact of commodity inflation on your margins. Quarter three margins were 8.3% nine months were close to 7.5%.A: If you look at the previous nine months, the hit on the margin was because of the other issues, like the inventory carrying cost. It was not largely because of the commodity. The commodity prices have started moving up in last three, four months only. So that impact is still about to come in, but we are hopeful that we should be able to get the price increase from the clients.Q: How many of your clients, what percentage of your clients have accepted a price increase already? What is the extent of price increase?A: Whatever, the commodity increase is always kind of a pass through to all our clients. And I would say, in the case of 60 to 70% the clients, we have already been able to get the price increase.PG Electroplast’s current market capitalisation is ₹16,695.42 crore.

December 2025 distributions are yet to be credited, which could further lift overall returns.According to Madhubani Sengupta, Head – Knowledge Services, ICRA Analytics, the year-on-year trend shows mixed movement within the trusts space, even as the overall category strengthened.“REITs nearly doubled their returns, rising from 16.81% in 2024 to 29.68% in 2025, reflecting sustained leasing momentum and consistent yield profiles.

As a result, sovereign bonds underperformed, while listed trusts continued to attract strong demand due to predictable cash flows, competitive yields, and rising interest in real estate- and infrastructure-backed investments.ICRA Analytics said public trusts have positioned themselves as a resilient alternative to traditional equities and fixed-income products, particularly for investors seeking regular distributions alongside capital appreciation.",

The US has agreed to lower reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports from 25% to 18% and has removed the punitive 25% duty on Indo-Russian oil trade. This 32 percentage point reduction places Indian exports in a more competitive position and is anticipated to trigger a chain reaction of market and economic benefits.\nMotilal Oswal highlights the deal as a high-impact event, suggesting it will stimulate Indian market performance both in the immediate term and over a longer horizon. The sectors expected to benefit most include auto ancillaries, defence, consumer products, textiles, electronic manufacturing services, consumer durables, IT services, as well as financial and utility companies.\nThe announcement addresses longstanding uncertainty and negative sentiment. The deal’s resolution lifts a major overhang on investor confidence, which had persisted due to months of stalled negotiations and apprehensions regarding India’s trade leverage with the US.\nOn the macroeconomic side, Motilal Oswal notes: \"multiple positives will accrue in the form of 1) reversal of FII outflows, 2) INR recovering its lost ground, 3) general improvement in sentiments towards Indian equities, 4) return of confidence for FDI, and 5) retracement of India’s underperformance vs. EM peers, etc.\" This reflects the anticipated reversal of adverse trends that have affected Indian equities .\nThe timing of the deal surprised market participants. Motilal Oswal stated: \"In most of our recent investor interactions, we sensed that the majority expected the deal discussions to be protracted, with completion around 2HCY26, ahead of the US midterm elections.\" The earlier-than-expected announcement is expected to improve sentiment and trigger reallocation into Indian equities.\nMotilal Oswal describes the event as a \"structurally 'positive allocation effect'\", indicating a fundamental improvement for India’s long-term market performance. Strained Indo-US relations since April 2024 had contributed to about 40% underperformance against emerging market peers, as well as USD 22 billion of FII withdrawals and a 6% rupee depreciation since January 2025.\nMotilal Oswal adds: \"we believe many of these adverse trends are now likely to reverse.\" The brokerage expects renewed FII flows and rupee stability, improving India’s relative standing among emerging markets.\nThe drop in tariffs means Indian goods move from being among the most heavily taxed imports in the US to some of the least taxed. Only Switzerland, the EU, the UK, Japan, and South Korea offer lower tariffs, but their exports have less overlap with India due to differences in value chain positioning. Major emerging-market competitors such as China, Vietnam, Brazil, Thailand, and South Africa will continue to face higher tariffs, ranging from 19% to 40%.\nThis trade agreement follows the Indo-EU free trade deal signed the previous week, as well as recent deals with the UK, EFTA, Oman, and New Zealand. Motilal Oswal points to these developments as evidence of India’s increasing importance in global trade and strategic relations.\nMotilal Oswal maintains a constructive view on Indian corporate earnings: \"With this deal announcement, we believe that the market will now begin to accord correct weightage to the improving trajectory of corporate earnings growth, which has shown successive improvement over the quarters with an improving earnings revision trend.\" The brokerage also reports: \"We had expected a 16% YoY growth in MOFSL PAT at the start of 3QFY26, and the results to date have been in line with our estimates.\" For Nifty, Motilal Oswal projects: \"We expect ~12% earnings growth for Nifty over FY25-27E.\" Valuations remain below the 10-year average, with 20.4x seen as reasonable in the current context.\nMotilal Oswal has picked Bharat Forge, Balkrishna Tyres, Raymond Lifestyle, Indo Count, Kitex, Welspun Living, Gokaldas Exports, LT Foods, Bluestar, Polycab, KEI Industries, Avalon Tech, Dixon Tech, SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, Waaree Energies, Home First Finance, Aptus Housing and IT companies as key beneficiaries of the trade deal.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

        "full_content": "PB Fintech stock fell around 6% on Tuesday despite the company’s decent performance on key parameters in the December quarter (Q3FY26). Among the positives, revenue rose 37% year-on-year to ₹ 1,771 crore, driven by growth in core online revenue and new initiatives revenue. Insurance premiums jumped 45% and lending disbursals surged 85%. The adjusted Ebitda margin improved to 11% from 6% last year.\nNew protection premiums grew 68% year-on-year, with health insurance alone growing nearly 80%. Protection products are stickier, renew every year, and create a long-term annuity stream. This recurring revenue is one of the biggest drivers of steady profit improvement.\nHowever, negative margins in the new initiatives business was a sore point. New initiatives include PB Partners, which allows insurance agents to sell policies using Policybazaar’s technology; and PB for Business, which offers employee health and group insurance to companies. Two years ago, this segment contributed about 32% of revenue. In Q3FY26, this rose to 41%. More importantly, it accounted for 44% of the incremental revenue growth this quarter.\nRevenue from new initiatives grew 41% year-on-year. Adjusted Ebitda margins for this segment improved from -7% last year to -3% this quarter, and contribution margins turned positive at around 6%. Management indicated that most of these businesses were approaching breakeven, with PB UAE already profitable for four straight quarters.\nPB Partners now works with more than 400,000 advisors and has deep reach in tier 4 and tier 5 towns, aiding scale and fixed cost absorption. Management is upbeat on its insurance growth and expects it to outpace the industry. On margins, the focus is now on operating leverage rather than aggressive cost cuts.\nQIP announcement But most of the positives were overshadowed by the announcement that the company’s board was slated to meet on 5 February to consider raising capital through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) to pursue inorganic growth opportunities abroad. \"With the company already sitting on a more than ₹ 5000 crore cash pile, the requirement of a QIP suggests a large acquisition, potentially resulting in 5-6% dilution,\" JM Financial Institutional Securities. Management has said that the acquisition will be earnings-per-share-accretive. However, JM Financial said it would need to be at a significant valuation discount as Indian markets were unlikely to ascribe PB’s current trading multiple to the international entity. There is also a potential headwind from further rationalization of distribution commissions. Developments related to BIMA Sugam – an aggregator-like platform for insurance sales and related services by insurance regulator IRDAI – should also be monitored. Against this backdrop, the company's valuation at 62 times estimated FY27E earnings per share seems expensive and prices in expectations of extraordinary growth.

The development follows an investigation into investment flows from Little Internet Singapore into the Indian entity, linked to transactions between March 2016 and June 2017. The RBI has imposed a compounding fee of Rs 18.76 lakh in relation to these transactions, which involved an aggregate value of approximately Rs 33 crore.\nIn a regulatory disclosure on Monday, Paytm stated: \"In a stock exchange filing on Monday, the company said the RBI has imposed a compounding fee of Rs 18.76 lakh in connection with certain investments made in Little Internet Private Limited by Little Internet Singapore.\" The company clarified that the order pertains only to the specific historic transactions identified in the RBI review.\nPaytm explained that it is taking the necessary steps to comply with the order: \"Paytm said it is in the process of paying the amount.\" The company further assured stakeholders that the penalty would not have a significant effect on its financial health or day-to-day operations.\n\"The company said the RBI order is not expected to have a material impact on its financials or operations.\" This statement comes as Paytm seeks to maintain stability amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny within the fintech sector.\nPaytm had previously acquired hyperlocal discovery platforms Little Internet and Nearbuy in 2017, merging them into its wider business portfolio. Little Internet was backed by Tiger Global Management and Elevation Capital, while Nearbuy, cofounded by Ankur Warikoo, counted Peak XV Partners as investors. These acquisitions expanded Paytm's offerings and were part of a broader diversification strategy.\nThe compounding order enables Paytm to settle the FEMA contravention by paying the monetary penalty, thereby avoiding further adjudication or prosecution. Authorities often use such orders as an expedient method to resolve technical violations without resorting to protracted legal proceedings.\nPaytm (One 97 Communications Ltd.) posted a profit after tax of ₹225 crore for the quarter ended December 2025, marking a sharp turnaround from a net loss of ₹208 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The year-on-year improvement in profitability stood at ₹433 crore.\nRevenue from operations rose 20% year-on-year to ₹2,194 crore, compared with ₹1,829 crore in the year-ago period. The growth was driven by higher payments gross merchandise value (GMV), a rise in merchant subscription revenues, and increased traction in the distribution of financial services, the company said.\nPaytm’s UPI business continued to gain momentum, with market share expanding for the third consecutive quarter.

Shaadi.com founder and Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal has weighed into the ongoing debate around Gen Z job-hopping, calling out what he describes as “career gurus” for shaming young professionals who switch roles frequently in their early 20s. “Early in our careers, we’re essentially dating industries, roles, and cultures to find what fits,” Mittal wrote, adding that young professionals should not feel guilty about moving on if a role doesn’t align with their interests. “When I’m hiring for senior leadership or Level 1 roles, I almost always reject resumes that don’t show at least one four-to-five-year stint,” he said. Based on his experience as a founder and investor, Mittal outlined a simple career framework -- one should explore aggressively and even switch roles, if needed, and identify what they genuinely enjoy when they are 21-24 years old.

According to him, early career years are meant for discovering passions, testing industries, and understanding workplace cultures.\n“Early in our careers, we’re essentially dating industries, roles, and cultures to find what fits,” Mittal wrote, adding that young professionals should not feel guilty about moving on if a role doesn’t align with their interests.\nHowever, the entrepreneur drew a clear line between early experimentation and long-term inconsistency. Mittal said that while exploration is healthy in the early 20s, prolonged job-hopping later can become a red flag—especially for senior leadership roles.\n“When I’m hiring for senior leadership or Level 1 roles, I almost always reject resumes that don’t show at least one four-to-five-year stint,” he said.\nExplaining his reasoning, Mittal pointed out that the real impact of professional decisions often becomes visible only after several years. “Year one is about learning, year two is execution, and year three is dealing with the consequences of those decisions—and scaling what worked,” he noted.\nBased on his experience as a founder and investor, Mittal outlined a simple career framework -- one should explore aggressively and even switch roles, if needed, and identify what they genuinely enjoy when they are 21-24 years old.\nMittal added that when you are aged 25 and above, you should commit to a company or role worth investing in and build depth over four or more years.\nHe also linked long-term commitment to leadership readiness, stating that aspiring founders and CEOs must demonstrate the ability to stay through challenging phases. “You need to prove you can stay in the kitchen when it gets hot,” he said.\nHe concluded by emphasising that while it may take a year to understand a job, it takes three to five years to truly understand an industry—“and that’s when you really start to win.”\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

What is the reason for that and when can we expect a recovery?A:  We are a business we should be tracked on last twelve months , not quarter-on-quarter, because single licence revenue could be as high as ₹50 crore to ₹100 crore, difference can create a marginal  difference. Where revenue grew 23% on LTM basis, my margin grew 33% on LTM basis, my cash position move 49% year-to-year.Now this is a phenomenal quarter from our internal perspective, quarterly number we cannot manage, and we don't want to manage because the deal size are big, contracts are complex and they cannot be tracked on 90 day period.Q: Since we are not talking about quarterly numbers on of FY26 basis and FY27 basis, now if you have some visibility, what kind of margins are you looking at? In terms of growth as well what kind of deal wins and growth are you looking at?A: If I look at it, our three businesses, which we started, global transaction banking  business is a ₹1,400 crore business, consumer banking  business, we started in 2018 that is close to ₹1,000 crore - ₹960 crore. Our geography distribution is America, which is giving 25% revenue, it will be close to ₹1000 crore with a new deal signing it up, it will further accelerate.Europe is another, 25% revenue comes from there, and rest of 50% comes from Middle East.",

Analyst on the street, who are anticipating a steady state-run rate of over 20% but this time around, it's been quite muted. What is the reason for that and when can we expect a recovery?A:  We are a business we should be tracked on last twelve months , not quarter-on-quarter, because single licence revenue could be as high as ₹50 crore to ₹100 crore, difference can create a marginal  difference. So, margin trajectory should be looked at it from the annualised basis.Last 12 months, we crossed ₹3,000 crore, very significant mark in Indian IT industry, a product company is crossing ₹3,000 crore revenue in last 12 month period. Where revenue grew 23% on LTM basis, my margin grew 33% on LTM basis, my cash position move 49% year-to-year.Now this is a phenomenal quarter from our internal perspective, quarterly number we cannot manage, and we don't want to manage because the deal size are big, contracts are complex and they cannot be tracked on 90 day period.Q: Since we are not talking about quarterly numbers on of FY26 basis and FY27 basis, now if you have some visibility, what kind of margins are you looking at? Will they on a consolidated basis see the 20% mark? In terms of growth as well what kind of deal wins and growth are you looking at?A: If I look at it, our three businesses, which we started, global transaction banking  business is a ₹1,400 crore business, consumer banking  business, we started in 2018 that is close to ₹1,000 crore - ₹960 crore. The AI business, we started in 2021, with the wealth and insurance included, is close to ₹500 crore business. So these three businesses are healthy businesses. Our geography distribution is America, which is giving 25% revenue, it will be close to ₹1000 crore with a new deal signing it up, it will further accelerate.Europe is another, 25% revenue comes from there, and rest of 50% comes from Middle East. And Africa itself gives the ₹600 crore revenue and then India and APAC this is a second lever, which is there. Third is the eMACH.ai. Fourth - what you asked - what opportunities are there for next year is a huge shift in moving from mainframe to cloud business. That is other area where the bigger opportunities are coming in our way. These deals are big in size, so these deals can run into millions of dollar deals. So that's why it takes time to close those deals. AI is a big driver for us.Q: Can you quantify it, so FY27 what is the kind of growth you will end the year with? You know, even if you track it on an LTM basis. And FY27 what kind of growth are you seeing? And can we expect margins to recover back to double digit, or even 20% levels that earlier you used to enjoy? A: We designed the business for 20% growth year-on-year and margins are also about 20%. Now we are in the investment phase, so we move to 25% and come back to 21% so these are the two bandwidth range we designed the business.Intellect Design Arena’s current market capitalisation is ₹11,384.16 crore.

The final winner under the Advanced Multirole Combat Aircraft (AMCA) programme is expected to be selected within the next three months , after the shortlisted companies submit detailed commercial proposals for manufacturing prototypes of the next-generation fighter jets, The Economic Times had reported earlier. The shortlisting was carried out based on parameters such as technical expertise, manufacturing capability, order book position and financial strength. Bidders were required to demonstrate their ability to absorb the AMCA design, along with adequate experience in development, engineering, manufacturing, integration and testing. One of the eligibility criteria also discouraged companies with a large outstanding order book. As per the current plan, the selected company will partner with the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) to build five AMCA prototypes. The defence ministry has earmarked an indicative budget of Rs 15,000 crore for the prototype development phase. The eventual production order, however, is expected to be several times larger once the aircraft is successfully developed and inducted by the Indian Air Force. The AMCA programme is widely regarded as India’s largest-ever military research and development initiative. The fifth-generation fighter jet is expected to form the backbone of the country’s air combat capability from the mid-2030s. An initial batch of 120 aircraft is likely to be ordered, with deliveries projected to begin around 2035.

The company’s net profit also fell 35% YoY to Rs 8.8 crore, from Rs 13.68 crore a year earlier. The company attributed the decline in revenue primarily to the deconsolidation of its esports and events arm, Nodwin Gaming, which was de-subsidiarised last year. In the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, Nodwin had contributed Rs 165 crore to Nazara’s consolidated revenue, which was absent in the current quarter. Despite the YoY decline, the company returned to profitability on a sequential basis, reporting a profit in Q3 after posting a net loss of Rs 34 crore in Q2FY26. The Q2 loss was largely driven by an impairment charge on Nazara’s investment in Moonshine Technologies, the parent of PokerBaazi, following the regulatory ban on real-money gaming. Strong 9MFY26 performance For the nine months ended FY26 (9MFY26), Nazara reported a strong performance, with revenue rising 29.7% year-on-year to Rs 1,431.2 crore, while EBITDA surged 73% YoY to Rs 177.2 crore. The robust growth translated into a marked improvement in profitability, with EBITDA margins expanding to 12.4% during the period. Live Events The company’s flagship kids’ learning app, Kiddopia, saw a long-awaited revival in subscriber growth, supported by Nazara’s Centres of Excellence across user acquisition, data analytics, growth and product development. Nazara also continued to expand its intellectual property (IP) portfolio, including the launch of Animal Jam on Roblox, unlocking new platform-led growth opportunities. Associate company NODWIN Gaming delivered a strong operational performance and remained profitable during the quarter. Management commentary Commenting on the results, Joint Managing Director and CEO Nitish Mittersain said the company continues to make steady progress towards building a global gaming platform. He highlighted disciplined execution, improving operating efficiency and multiple growth drivers across new launches, live content expansion and platform extensions. He also reiterated Nazara’s focus on disciplined capital allocation and strategic acquisitions to drive long-term value creation. Nazara Technologies shares ended Tuesday’s session 1.54% higher at Rs 284.60 on the NSE. The company announced its quarterly earnings after market hours On the technical front, the 14-day RSI stands at 59.6, indicating neutral-to-positive momentum and remaining well below overbought levels.

        "full_content": "Textile stock Gokaldas Exports share price surged over 18%, continuing its sharp upward move on Wednesday, February 4, after a 20% surge in the previous session. The strong rally came as the textile sector emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the newly announced India–US trade deal. It has skyrocketed over 40% in just 2 sessions.\nIndia and the United States have agreed to a trade arrangement under which reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods will be reduced to 18% from 25%. In addition, the extra 25% duty on imports of Russian crude oil will be removed. US President Donald Trump said the agreement would be effective immediately. The development has significantly improved sentiment for textile companies, most of which derive between 50% and 70% of their total revenue from the US market.\nAdding to the positive outlook, the Union Budget announcement on setting up Mega Textile Parks has further strengthened the sector narrative.\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget 2026–27 speech on Sunday, said Mega Textile Parks would be developed in challenge mode with a focus on integrated infrastructure and value addition. The initiative forms part of a broader five-pronged policy framework aimed at boosting India’s employment-intensive textile industry. The proposed parks are expected to attract fresh investment, enhance compliance and traceability, and create integrated hubs that support scale, quality control, and exports.\nGokaldas Exports rose as much as 18.5% intraday to hit a high of ₹ 827. With a 20% jump in the previous session, the stock has surged around 43% in just two trading days.\nOther textile stocks also saw strong moves after confirmation of the India–US trade deal, though intraday performance on Wednesday was mixed. Kitex Garments jumped 14%, while Adhinath Textiles was locked in an upper circuit. Trident gained over 3.5%, KPR Mills traded largely flat, Welspun Living declined more than 6%, Vardhman Textiles slipped over 3%, and Indo Count Industries fell more than 2%.\nIn its Q3 FY26 results, Gokaldas Exports reported a sharp decline in profitability. Consolidated net profit fell 70.97% year-on-year to ₹ 14.61 crore, compared with ₹ 50.34 crore in Q3 FY25. Revenue from operations declined marginally by 0.92% YoY to ₹ 978.65 crore during the quarter.\nThe company said its India operations continued to show resilience, delivering 8% YoY growth despite facing the first full-quarter impact of US tariffs. However, uncertainty around the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and supply chain disruptions weighed on its African business during the period.\nEBITDA declined 18% YoY to ₹ 96 crore, while the EBITDA margin contracted by 202 basis points YoY to 9.7% in Q3 FY26. The company attributed the margin pressure mainly to the impact of US tariff rebates. It noted that productivity improvements, a strong order book, and tighter cost management helped absorb part of the impact.\nMarket experts believe the trade deal could provide a meaningful tailwind for Indian textile exporters, particularly those with high exposure to the US market.\nAnil Rego, Founder and Fund Manager at Right Horizons PMS, said the agreement could materially improve competitiveness for Indian exporters. “For textiles, the impact is particularly significant given the US is one of the largest end markets for Indian apparel and home textiles. Reduced tariffs enhance price competitiveness against peers such as China and Bangladesh, potentially leading to order diversion in India’s favour. Higher volumes, better capacity utilisation, and operating leverage could gradually translate into margin recovery and more stable earnings for exporters,” he said.\nHowever, experts caution that gains may not be uniform across the sector. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVAsset PMS, said the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be companies with strong execution, value-added offerings, and substantial US exposure. He expects export-focused apparel manufacturers to see faster order normalisation as US buyers diversify sourcing away from higher-tariff regions.\nDasani identified Gokaldas Exports, Indo Count Industries, Welspun Living, Pearl Global Industries, and KPR Mills as potential beneficiaries of the shift. “Gokaldas Exports stands out as a direct play on US apparel demand, while Pearl Global Industries offers leverage to garment exports with improving scale. In home textiles, Indo Count Industries and Welspun Living are well positioned given their long-standing US retailer relationships and ability to absorb volume growth,” he said.\nAt the same time, he believes the opportunity is selective, noting that commodity-heavy yarn manufacturers may see limited upside as pricing gains tend to be competed away.\nOops!

Weak cues from the US markets weighed heavily on sentiment, where counterparts of Indian software majors fell sharply amid growing worries that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could intensify competition for traditional software companies.\nInvestor anxiety was sparked after new software updates linked to Anthropic-driven AI models suggested faster innovation cycles and the potential for greater disruption across enterprise software and services. The developments revived fears that AI-led automation and new platforms could squeeze margins for established IT services firms, prompting traders to cut exposure to the sector.\nAt 10.10 am, the Nifty IT index traded at 36,590.80 after falling nearly 6 per cent to 36,297.90 in early trade from the previous close of 38,611.75.\nHeavy selling was visible across frontline counters. Persistent Systems , LTIMindtree , Coforge , Infosys , Tata Consultancy Services, Mphasis and HCL Technologies were among the worst hit stocks, dragging the broader technology index lower. Shares of these companies declined sharply in the opening sessions as institutional investors reacted to the negative global cues.\nHeavyweight Infosys depreciated over 6 per cent to ₹1,551.20 against the previous close of ₹1,656. TCS also fell 6 per cent to ₹3,031.20.\nMarket participants said the fall reflected both near-term nervousness over pricing power in IT services and concerns that clients in developed markets could reassess technology spending in an environment of rapidly evolving AI capabilities.\nThe sharp drop in US-listed tech stocks overnight further amplified risk-off sentiment at home, leading to a broad-based sell-off across IT names.

Anthropic’s launch of workplace productivity tools intensified worries, with the sector shedding approximately $300 billion in market value, Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research, HDFC Securities, said.\nFor now, volatility is expected to remain elevated as markets digest the implications of new AI-driven products and their potential impact on traditional software and outsourcing models.\nPublished on  February 4, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

        "full_content": "IT stocks came under intense pressure in early trade on Wednesday, with the Nifty IT index plunging more than 5 per cent, tracking a steep sell-off in global technology shares. Weak cues from the US markets weighed heavily on sentiment, where counterparts of Indian software majors fell sharply amid growing worries that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could intensify competition for traditional software companies.\nInvestor anxiety was sparked after new software updates linked to Anthropic-driven AI models suggested faster innovation cycles and the potential for greater disruption across enterprise software and services. The developments revived fears that AI-led automation and new platforms could squeeze margins for established IT services firms, prompting traders to cut exposure to the sector.\nAt 10.10 am, the Nifty IT index traded at 36,590.80 after falling nearly 6 per cent to 36,297.90 in early trade from the previous close of 38,611.75.\nHeavy selling was visible across frontline counters. Persistent Systems , LTIMindtree , Coforge , Infosys , Tata Consultancy Services, Mphasis and HCL Technologies were among the worst hit stocks, dragging the broader technology index lower. Shares of these companies declined sharply in the opening sessions as institutional investors reacted to the negative global cues.\nHeavyweight Infosys depreciated over 6 per cent to ₹1,551.20 against the previous close of ₹1,656. TCS also fell 6 per cent to ₹3,031.20.\nMarket participants said the fall reflected both near-term nervousness over pricing power in IT services and concerns that clients in developed markets could reassess technology spending in an environment of rapidly evolving AI capabilities.\nThe sharp drop in US-listed tech stocks overnight further amplified risk-off sentiment at home, leading to a broad-based sell-off across IT names. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.4 per cent as software stocks extended losses. Anthropic’s launch of workplace productivity tools intensified worries, with the sector shedding approximately $300 billion in market value, Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research, HDFC Securities, said.\nFor now, volatility is expected to remain elevated as markets digest the implications of new AI-driven products and their potential impact on traditional software and outsourcing models.\nPublished on  February 4, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

        "full_content": "The sharp global sell-off in software stocks has set off fresh anxiety around Indian IT services, with investors beginning to worry that artificial intelligence could start eating into future growth. But experts differ on how quickly that pressure will show up in numbers.Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner at Geosphere Capital Management, believes the market is looking past current earnings and focusing on how business models might change. “People have now started worrying about different segments, and IT services is the latest one to get this concern,” he said. In his view, the sell-off reflects deeper unease about where value will sit in a more AI-driven tech stack. “This is about concern about future growth, future value.”Sanger does not see this as a short-term earnings problem. “This may not be a one-year call, but this is a two-, three-, four-year. There’s real headwinds emerging that could be very meaningful,” he said. The fear, he explained, is that if AI agents can take over more routine and process-driven tasks, demand for traditional services work could come under pressure. “At some point, people are realising that even the software services companies are going to suffer.”He also questioned whether Indian IT services valuations adequately reflect this risk. With the sector trading at around 20 times earnings for 7–8% growth, Sanger asked, “What happens if that earnings growth disappears in a couple of years?” arguing that markets are underpricing the possibility of AI-led disruption to the core services model.Worries around Indian IT services picked up after a sharp overnight sell-off in US software stocks spilled over into Indian names, erasing significant market value early in the session.The trigger was rising concern that AI tools are shifting from assistance to direct automation, especially after Anthropic expanded its Claude agent with plug-ins for legal work, document review, compliance and enterprise workflows.

Guidance looked better than expected,” he noted.Katri agreed that AI disruption is a serious theme but said the numbers have not yet shown broad damage. “Ultimately, the proof is going to be in the numbers,” he said. For now, he sees companies adjusting through “reskilling and repositioning their models.”On Indian IT specifically, Katri said the sector could still play an important role in the next phase of AI adoption, especially in integration and data preparation. “We do believe that there’s going to be a spending cycle that focuses on integration and data,” he said. “The sector is very well positioned from the infrastructure side of AI, massaging the data, preparing it to basically get fed into those accelerators.” At the same time, he added that “it’s going to take some time until those projects really gain traction.”He linked the sector’s prolonged underperformance largely to sentiment. “The underperformance continues to be a function of sentiment,” he said, adding that “the next 12 months will probably be better than the last 12 months.”Also Read: See 40-70% upside in Indian IT stocks as sector nears business cycle turn: Motilal Oswal's Abhishek PathakFor the entire discussion, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

The deal, announced jointly by US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reduces reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports to 18%. Following a 20% gain on Tuesday, the stock extended its rally on Wednesday, climbing another 20% intraday to hit Rs 832.85 on the NSE. Under the new agreement, Indian exports to the US will face an 18% tariff, which is lower than other major garment-exporting countries, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, where tariffs remain at 20%. Overall, US tariffs on Indian goods will be cut from 50% to 18%, while India has agreed to reduce its tariff and non-tariff barriers on US products to zero. The textile sector has been particularly sensitive to US trade policies, as most Indian textile exporters earn 50–70% of their revenue from the US market. For Gokaldas Exports, the US accounts for nearly 70% of total revenue, making the company a major beneficiary of the deal. The recent stock rally marks a significant turnaround for Gokaldas Exports. Over the past year, the stock had declined about 14%, but over the past three years, it has delivered substantial gains of 136%, doubling investor wealth. Live Events From a valuation perspective, Gokaldas Exports currently trades at a PE ratio of 43.44 and a PB ratio of 2.38, indicating relatively high investor expectations. Gokaldas Exports reported quarterly revenue of Rs 998 crore for Dec-2025, reflecting a slight decline of 0.3% year-on-year. The company’s net profit for the quarter stood at Rs 15 crore, marking a sharp drop of 71% YoY. In terms of shareholding, both Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and Mutual Funds (MFs) increased their stakes during the December quarter. FIIs raised their holdings from 22.93% to 23.71%, while Mutual Funds increased their stake from 34.24% to 35.03%. From a technical perspective, Gokaldas Exports remains bullish. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 57.3, suggesting the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, the stock is trading above 7 of 8 key Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating strong upward momentum.

        "full_content": "Concept Debut: Bentley has unveiled the Bentayga X Concept, an off-road-focused version of the Bentayga Speed. The vehicle previews a possible production SUV designed with stronger off-road ability. Bentley says the concept was created to collect public and customer feedback on a Bentayga with greater capability beyond standard road use. Powertrain Base: The concept keeps the Bentayga Speed’s 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 petrol engine producing 650 PS, or about 641 bhp. Power is sent to all four wheels through a permanent all-wheel-drive system and an eight-speed automatic gearbox. The air suspension and the 48-volt active anti-roll control system are also retained. Chassis Changes: Mechanical revisions centre on ground clearance and stability. Ride height is raised by 55 mm, increasing ground clearance to about 310 mm. Track width is expanded by 120 mm to improve balance on uneven ground. The wheel arches are extended outward by 40 mm to accommodate the wider stance. Off-road Hardware: The SUV uses forged 22-inch single-piece wheels from Brixton with high-profile all-terrain tyres. These changes increase water-wading depth to more than 550 mm. The revised dimensions move the Bentayga X Concept closer to the measurements typical of purpose-built off-road vehicles. Exterior Updates: The Bentayga’s main body shape is retained, but several functional changes are visible. The lower front bumper, wheel arches, side skirts and rear splitter receive a black finish. The front bumper includes twin towing points. A roof rack is fitted, carrying four auxiliary spotlights intended to support driving in low-visibility environments. Exhaust System: At the rear, the concept features a titanium sports exhaust developed by Akrapovič. The system is designed to handle demanding use while preserving performance characteristics from the Bentayga Speed. This modification supports the vehicle’s shift toward multi-surface driving rather than road-only use. Event Debut: The Bentayga X Concept debuted at the FAT Ice Race in Zell am See, Austria. The winter event combines motorsport and car culture and marks the beginning of a multi-year partnership between Bentley and FAT International. Skijoring Display: During the event, automotive presenter Chris Harris drove a Bentayga in a Skijöring demonstration, towing Norwegian freestyle skier Hedvig Wessel. The activity demonstrated vehicle control and traction on ice, aligning with the concept’s focus on operation in low-grip conditions. Segment Trend: Bentley’s study follows similar moves by other performance brands. Examples include the Porsche 911 Dakar and the Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato, both adapted for rougher surfaces. These models show demand for high-performance vehicles that can operate beyond paved roads while keeping their core engineering layouts. Production Outlook: Bentley has not confirmed production of the X Concept. The company states the vehicle was developed to measure interest in a more off-road-capable Bentayga. Feedback gathered from the public and customers will guide future decisions on whether such a version should join the existing Bentayga range.",

However, Ebitda growth of 10 per cent YoY for the quarter fell short of Street expectations, largely due to an adverse pricing mix in India and softer domestic margins.

While the management is cautiously optimistic about delivering double-digit volume growth in India on a weak base and maintaining margins, aided by capacity additions at new plants and distribution expansion, ICICI Securities sees risks.\n\"International business performance remained strong with 10 per cent YoY volume growth, and is expected to benefit further from portfolio expansion (snacks portfolio, Carlsberg beer distribution) and Twizza acquisition (in Q2CY26).

The stock’s technical structure remains constructive, with prices holding above key long-term averages despite recent consolidation. This suggests the broader uptrend is still intact.”\nHe further noted that the power and renewable energy sector continues to perform well, supported by policy focus, rising capacity additions, and improving order visibility.\nOn the fundamentals, Suzlon has shown steady improvement in revenues, margins, and balance-sheet strength over recent quarters. “The market will now focus on execution consistency, order inflows, and cash-flow stability. If the company sustains its current operating performance, it should reinforce confidence that the turnaround is durable, keeping the medium-term outlook positive,” Rathod added.\nDuring its recent manufacturing day in December, the management reiterated confidence in a strong order book and a healthy order inflow outlook, with equipment yet to be awarded for around 18 GW of under-development capacity.

        "full_content": "Shares of Mankind Pharma Ltd dropped more than 4 per cent during the trading session on Wednesday after the company reported a sub-par performance in the December 2025 quarter. Results on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis came in weak and analysts have mixed views on the counter.\nBrokerages believe that Mankind Pharma is seeing steady gains in chronic therapies but muted overall growth due to weakness in acute segments and integration challenges. It is working to revive acute growth, scale up the BSV acquisition and improve productivity, while managing near-term margin and earnings pressure from debt-funded expansion.\nShares of Mankind Pharma dropped 4.45 per cent to Rs 2,060 on Wednesday, with its market capitalization slipping below Rs 86,000 crore. The stock had settled at Rs 2,155.90 in the previous trading session. Shares of Mankind Pharma have plunged nearly 25 per cent from its 52-week high at Rs 2,726.75 hit in July 2025.\nShares of Mankind Pharma were listed at the bourses in April 2023, when the company raised a total of Rs 4,326 crore from investors by selling its shares for Rs 1,080 apeice. The stock has gained more than 90 per cent from its IPO price so far.\nMankind Pharma reported a 9.5 per cent jump in the net profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis to Rs 414 crore, while revenue jumped 11.5 per cent YoY to Rs 3,567 crore for the three months ended on December 31, 2025. The company reported a 4.6 per cent YoY jump in the adjusted ebitda to 923 crore with ebitda margins contracting 170 basis points to 25.9 per cent.\nDomestic revenue registered a growth of 11.1 per cent YoY driven by growth in base business, further aided by BSV consolidation, while consumer healthcare revenue rose 5.2 per cent YoY, regaining sequential growth momentum. Exports revenue increased 14 per cent YoY primarily driven by healthy growth in BSV international business.\nConsistently maintained first rank over the last 8 years with prescription share of 15.2 per cent, said the company in its release. It clocked healthy growth in secondary sales for Gas-o-fast, Manforce Condom and Ova news of 33 per cent, 8 per cent and 36 per cent YoY respectively in Q3FY26.\nMankind not only increased the chronic share but also grew in line with industry in chronic therapies (excluding GLP1 launches). However, total secondary sales growth was muted due to an inferior show in acute therapies as the company implemented coarse corrective measures, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd .\nMankind is working on multiple fronts gaining market share in chronic therapies, reviving growth in acute therapies, integrating and building synergy from BSV acquisition, and d) revising business policy for consumer health business. The pick-up in growth from these corrective actions remains the key monitorable,\" it added with a 'buy' tag and a target price of Rs 2,505.\nOrganic India formulation growth was at 9.1% YoY, and exports grew in mid-single-digit, and BSV recorded sales of Rs 464 crore (India + Export). Mankind is on track to launch Semaglutide in India after patent expiry. While the BSV acquisition will be EBITDA-accretive, the debt-funded M&A could keep near-term earnings stressed, said HDFC Securities.\nMankind expects gradual recovery in the acute therapies after corrective measures to ensure the volume growth and productivity improvement; strong growth in key chronic segments led by traction in recently launched products; BSV: scale-up over next few quarters, targets to improve margin in the near term; and expand the presence in export markets, it said.\nFactoring Q3 miss, we have cut EPS estimates for FY26/27 to factor lower-than-expected margin and delay in synergies with BSV. We maintain 'add' with revised target price to Rs 2,460,\" HDFC Securities said.  \"We keep monitoring the progress in BSV business integration as well as growth momentum and debt repayment.\"\nNirmal Bang Institutional Equities sees revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 13 per cent/12 per cent/8 per cent over FY25–FY28E, factoring in a slower-than-anticipated recovery in the base business, delayed productivity normalization and lingering GST-related disruptions. Ebitda margins are expected to remain broadly stable at 24 per cent as operating efficiencies and product mix gains offset higher employee costs and R&D spend.\n\"Field-force productivity, especially in Tier 2–4 markets, remains a key monitorable as ramp-up of newly-recruited MRs is taking longer than expected. We estimate a healthy cumulative free cash flow generation of Rs 6,270 cror over FY26E–FY27E, most of which will likely be used for debt repayment. ROE/ROCE are expected to moderate by FY27E,\" it said with a 'hold' rating and target price of Rs 2,177.\nMankind’s revenue was in line with estimates, while Ebitda was slightly above but net earnings were below estimates due to one-off items. Organic domestic branded formulation growth remains subdued owing to integration / execution challenges, said Systematix Institutional Equities.\n\"The anti infective / acute business is also a drag on overall growth. Company reduced net debt by Rs.5000mn during the quarter (Net Debt to Ebitda at 1.3 times). We tweak our forecasts as we lower our expectations on domestic formulation growth. We roll over our price target to FY28E EPS and maintain 'hold' on Mankind Pharma with a revised target price of Rs 2,467,\" it adds.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

On that date, the Infosys stock slipped as much as 9.4 per cent to touch an intraday low of Rs 1,304.24 on BSE before eventually settling 8.18 per cent lower at Rs 1,322.94 apiece against its May 20, 2023, close of Rs 1,440.72. This eroded significant investor wealth, as the Infosys market capitalisation plunged by over Rs 54,000 crore, bringing its total market cap down to Rs 6.31 lakh crore, BSE data showed. And there is concern in the market that it will eat into the core business of data and information services firms,” said Mayuresh Joshi, Head of Equity Research at William O Neil India. The BSE IT index was down 6.21 per cent to 34,844.43\nThe effect was felt overnight in the US markets, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq index dropped 1.43 per cent to close at 23,255.19.",
        "full_content": "Shares of the Indian IT sector saw a steep decline on Wednesday, with heavyweights such as Infosys and TCS taking a massive hit following concerns about Anthropic's new offerings. Infosys, India's second-largest IT firm, plunged over 8 per cent, marking its steepest decline in over two years and six months.\nAt 12:22 pm, shares of Infosys plunged 8.23 per cent to trade at Rs 1518.80 on the BSE, a sharp drop against its previous close of Rs 1,654.95. This marks the most steepest single-day fall for Infosys since May 21, 2023. On that date, the Infosys stock slipped as much as 9.4 per cent to touch an intraday low of Rs 1,304.24 on BSE before eventually settling 8.18 per cent lower at Rs 1,322.94 apiece against its May 20, 2023, close of Rs 1,440.72.\nThis eroded significant investor wealth, as the Infosys market capitalisation plunged by over Rs 54,000 crore, bringing its total market cap down to Rs 6.31 lakh crore, BSE data showed. “I think what has really transpired late last night is that Anthropic has probably developed some sort of new AI automation tool. And there is concern in the market that it will eat into the core business of data and information services firms,” said Mayuresh Joshi, Head of Equity Research at William O Neil India.\nOther IT major shares also plunged. TCS was down 6.50 per cent to Rs 3,014 apiece, while Tech Mahindra dropped 5.79 per cent to trade at Rs 1,616.35.\nThe BSE IT index was down 6.21 per cent to 34,844.43\nThe effect was felt overnight in the US markets, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq index dropped 1.43 per cent to close at 23,255.19. “So I believe data processing firms, which make up a sizable portion of the Indian IT ecosystem, will be impacted. But it's not just IT stocks. Look at what happened to US stocks overnight. Atlassian, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Gartner, and Accenture stocks were all significantly lower,” Joshi said.\nAnthropic recently launched plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent, a move designed to automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing, and data analysis functions.\nWhile these plug-ins work across various use cases, they are reportedly powerful in tailoring Anthropic’s Claude to specific job functions such as sales, legal and financial analysis.\nVK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, noted that the rally fuelled by the US-India trade deal will face hurdles to sustain.\n\"The IT selloff in the US yesterday will drag the Indian IT index, too, constraining the rally in the Indian market. Since valuations continue to be high there is no fundamental support for a sustained rally,\" Vijayakumar added.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today.

        "full_content": "Hero MotoCorp is expected to post a healthy performance in the December quarter, aided by strong festive demand, an improved product mix and price hikes, even as market share pressures persist in some segments. Based on an average of six brokerage estimates, the company’s revenue is projected to rise about 19% year-on-year in Q3, while profit after tax is seen increasing 17% year-on-year. Sequential growth is expected to be more modest, reflecting a stabilising operating environment following the festive-season boost. Volumes are likely to be the key driver this quarter. Most analysts expect volume growth in the mid-teens, aided by festive demand and recovery in rural markets. HSBC expects overall volumes to be flat quarter-on-quarter but higher by around 16% on a YoY basis. Kotak Equities also builds in 16% YoY volume growth, driven by strong festive trends. Pricing and product mix are expected to offer incremental support. HSBC notes that discounts were flat sequentially, while the company took a price hike of about 50 basis points during the quarter. Kotak expects average selling prices to rise 2–2.5% YoY, helped by a richer mix, including a higher share of exports and scooters. Motilal Oswal adds that discounts were lower during the festive season and that the company implemented a sharp 10% price hike on electric vehicles from early December, which should aid realisations. Live Events On margins, expectations are largely stable to mildly positive. HSBC expects EBITDA margin to remain flat quarter-on-quarter at around 15%, as benefits from pricing and volumes are offset by competitive pressures. Motilal Oswal also expects margins to remain broadly stable QoQ, with operating leverage benefits likely to be neutralised by higher input costs, especially precious metals, and increased advertising spends. Kotak Equities is slightly more optimistic, expecting EBITDA margin to expand by about 60 basis points YoY to 15.1%, driven by operating leverage from higher volumes. Nuvama also expects margin expansion on a YoY basis, supported by better scale and mix. Segment-wise, some pressure points remain. HSBC highlights a sequential decline in the economy segment market share by about 70 basis points and a sharper 110 basis points drop in scooters. However, the brokerage points to sustained recovery in the entry-level motorcycle segment and flags the upcoming Splendor 125cc launch as an important trigger to watch. Electric vehicles remain an area of focus. HSBC notes a supply ramp-up in Vida, Hero’s EV brand, while Motilal Oswal factors in the recent price hike in EVs as margin-positive, albeit with near-term volume sensitivity. From an earnings perspective, healthy volumes are expected to translate into steady profit growth. Motilal Oswal expects PAT growth of about 13% YoY, slightly below the street average, reflecting its conservative margin assumptions. Overall consensus, however, points to mid-to-high teens profit growth. Looking ahead, analysts say commentary on demand outlook, rural recovery trends, and the launch timeline for new models, particularly in the 125cc category, will be closely watched.

That's the whole business.”Management said the recent rise in debt is largely linked to execution of new projects and refinancing of operational assets, rather than any stress on the balance sheet. Net debt remains at a comfortable level for a utility business, supported by long-term power purchase agreements  and predictable cash flows.In October-December quarter  ACME Solar Holdings reported revenue of ₹496 crore, and profit after tax at ₹113 crore and margins at 89.5%.While tariffs for plain battery projects have seen pressure recently, ACME Solar has largely stayed away from those bids. The company has focused on hybrid and round-the-clock projects, where tariffs are locked in at the time of winning bids and remain stable for 25 years.Management said the average tariff for upcoming capacity is higher than the existing portfolio average. In addition, higher capacity utilisation factors are expected to lift revenue per megawatt.Operating margins are also expected to stay strong, given the fixed-cost nature of the business. EBITDA margins have remained around 90% over the past few quarters, reflecting the stability of the model.With capacity additions planned in phases, the full financial benefit will flow through gradually as projects get commissioned. However, the long-term visibility remains strong due to fixed tariffs, long-duration PPAs, and limited variable costs.Watch accompanying video for moreCatch all the stock market live updates hereFollow our live blog for more updates on Q3 results",

However, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation  declined 2.3% to ₹367.6 crore from ₹376 crore, reflecting pressure on profitability.The operating profit margin softened to 25.5% from 27.7% a year ago, while profit after tax fell 10% to ₹244 crore, compared with ₹271 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The company’s market capitalisation currently stands at about ₹18,283.93 crore, and its shares have declined close to 2% over the past one year.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: The parent deal has now been announced. Historically, Stonepeak has delisted companies it has acquired, and that is one reason why, immediately after the announcement, the market began speculating that a similar move could happen at Castrol India as well. There is still uncertainty around this, but have you heard anything about what changes could follow from this transaction?A: Let me first address our Q4 numbers, and then I will respond to your question.First of all, I am very pleased to say that it has been the eighth straight quarter of volume growth, and volume growth ahead of the market, which has resulted in share gain. This has come on the back of us as a company executing the strategy that we had signalled earlier.We are building our business in terms of reach into rural India in a big way. We are scaling up our industrial business, and we have had a lot of product innovations that we have introduced throughout the year, which have enabled the core business to grow. And we are quite pleased with the results that we have seen at the end of the year.You are right in terms of EBITDA margin. We had signalled that EBITDA would be in the range of 21% to 24%. We actually came ahead of that. We are up beyond 25%. There are some one-time charges in Q4. But overall, I would like to reassure you that the Q4 operating parameters of the business remain very strong — a strong balance sheet, very strong cash flow, which allows us as a business to respond to the environment very proactively.The Stonepeak announcement has happened. It's a deal that is subject to closure, which has various regulatory things that will happen as and when it closes. I think, as a shareholder, they would announce whatever is next on the cards. But in the business, at Castrol India, we remain focused on executing our strategy, which is to go big into rural, scale up the industrial business, and we are also seeding in our services business.Q: Have you heard any kind of inkling whether or not there will be some action for the Indian entity? There's always that buzz, right? I have heard it for many, many years, actually, but now there is this fresh news that's come in.A: We are not involved in those conversations as an operating team; we are focused on our business.Q: So, let's focus on business then. Volume growth was close to around 8%. For this year, what kind of volume growth are you looking at? And also, if you could help us out with how much contribution comes in from electric vehicle  fluid sales. How much is it and where is it headed?A: To talk about volume growth, one has to look at the perspective of the market. We estimate that the market is slated to grow anywhere between 3.5% and 4.5%. What we aim for is to grow the volume-driven topline of this business, at 1.5-2x of the market, and through that, therefore, gain share. And we are doing that by going deep into rural India, because different parts of the country are growing at different rates. Different segments are growing at different rates.Also Read: Copper to lead the next base metals cycle as electric vehicle demand rises: Dhan founderOur strategy is focused on tapping into those opportunities and building the business to track growth as the market opens up. So that's what we are doing.To your second question, EVs are a growing part of the business, but small. But we are positioned to take advantage as and when the market expands. In two-wheelers, for example, it's around 10% of new sales that are EVs. In cars, it's less than that. But we have good partnerships with most of the original equipment manufacturers , and we have products in the market which are ready to be distributed as and when there's demand for that.Q: The industrial segment, you said that that's about 12% to 15% of your business, and you expect it to grow over a period of time. If you could give us a sense of what sort of targets you have earmarked for the industrial business.A: The industrial business grew double-digit last year, and that contributed to that 8% growth. We maintain that kind of guidance, which will be ahead of the average growth rate of the market. And because it's a small part of our business, it will grow much faster than the core business.We are focused on executing a strategy which is about growing into segments such as aerospace, cement and steel, where typically we have been underrepresented. And we have a team which is today going around the country today, introducing Castrol to customers in this segment, because that is what Castrol has not traditionally been associated with, and we have seen success on that front.Q: Do you think the industrial business grows two times of your core growth, which itself will be 1.5-2x of the industry growth?A: That is the kind of range that the industrial business has been delivering, and I expect the industrial business to sustain that level of growth.Q: You have also indicated that you are developing products for the data centre business. Are you in talks with hyperscalers and other big clients globally as well? Give us some colour on this.A: Yes, we are in talks, and some of these are global accounts. As you can imagine, hyperscalers are businesses that set up data centres across the world, and there are trials that are happening in India, and the trials are happening in different parts of the world.We are also putting innovation into those products and working through what would be the next cycle of products that will be launched into the market. So very much engaged — again, a small part of our business and a small opportunity today, but positioning us for growth into the future.Also Read: Castrol India eyes 21-24% margin band as rural and industrial segments pick upQ: From a data centre standpoint, what proportion of their bill of materials  would be the product that you sell? We just want to understand, because by and large, the opportunity is huge. Everyone talks about that, but what kind of value chain benefit would accrue to players like you?A: Early days to estimate that, because the technology itself is evolving quite a bit, and there are different kinds of cooling technologies in play. Their core business is not about manufacturing and producing something. So, it's about serving the requirement of removing heat so that the data centres operate at a high degree of efficiency, and we have products which enable that particular outcome.Watch the interview in the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

        "full_content": "(representative image)\nThe easing of rare-earth supply is expected to drive electric two-wheeler volume growth in India to 16-18 per cent next fiscal after moderating to 12-13 per cent in the ongoing fiscal due to supply chain constraints, according to Crisil Ratings.\nThis fiscal, the electric two-wheeler (E2W) growth is expected to moderate due to temporary disruptions in the supply of rare-earth magnets and the goods and services tax (GST) rationalisation on internal combustion engine (ICE) models, Crisil Ratings said in a statement.\nIn the previous fiscal, E2W volume growth was at 22 per cent, it added.\n“The supply disruption caused by the shortage of rare-earth magnets had weighed on E2W volumes around mid-year. As availability began to ease, coinciding with the GST-led price revision in ICE models, OEMs relied on discounting and introduced lower-priced electric models to narrow the ICE-EV price gap,” Crisil Ratings Senior Director Anuj Sethi said.\nWhile this has supported a recovery in volumes in recent months, the impact of the earlier supply disruption is expected to limit full-year growth to 12-13 per cent, he added.\n“With supply conditions improving, reflecting a gradual resumption of inflow of magnets from China alongside initial steps by OEMs to diversify sourcing, growth is expected to re-accelerate to 16-18 per cent next fiscal, assuming stable availability of rare-earth magnets,\" Sethi said.\nCrisil Ratings said the expected growth of 16-18 per cent is supported by a structural ownership-cost advantage. However, competitive pressure is creating divergent risk profiles, with legacy players better insulated, while new-age players continue to face weak unit-vehicle economics.\n“An analysis of 10 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), comprising four legacy players with ICE and E2W portfolios and six new-age, EV-only players, indicates as much,\" it said, adding these OEMs account for about 85 per cent of the E2W volume.\nE2W adoption continues to be supported by strong vehicle economics. While GST rate cuts have reduced the purchase cost of ICE vehicles, running costs favour E2Ws, at about 3 paisa/km versus ₹2-2.5/km for ICE, continuing their advantage in total cost of ownership even as subsidies taper, it said.\nWith incentives being phased out and the pace of decline in battery cost (which accounts for 35-40 per cent of total costs) slowing after a sharp correction over the past two fiscals, Crisil Ratings said price-led competition has narrowed.\nIncreasingly, reliability and service are becoming more important differentiators, and this is where legacy OEMs are scoring high at present, it added.\n“The market share of legacy players has increased to 62 per cent by January 2026 from 47 per cent a year earlier, clearly outperforming new-age players,\" Crisil Ratings Director, Poonam Upadhyay, said.\nThe share gain reflects their stronger dealer reach and supplier ecosystems, alongside an expanded range of entry-level and mid-priced electric models that enable faster rollout, wider availability, and more consistent execution, Upadhyay noted.\nPublished on  February 4, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

The current level is about 23 to 24%.Q: Lastly, could you talk to us about the strategy behind the foray into the commercial mobility segment?A: I think this is a very interesting segment, and we have seen the segment really grow, especially post COVID, in the last three to four years, when people are looking for shared mobility.",
        "full_content": "Hyundai Motor India plans to increase exports as part of its long-term production strategy, according to Managing Director and CEO Tarun Garg. The company is focusing on using its existing manufacturing capacity to support both domestic and export demand.Hyundai plans to increase the share of exports in total production over the next few years. Garg said exports currently contribute about 23–24% of total production. He said, “we intend to go to 30%.” The company has set this as a long-term target for the fiscal year 2029-30 .The company currently has total production capacity of about 994,000 units across its plants. He said the company has about 824,000 units of capacity in Chennai and about 170,000 units in Pune.He said exports have remained a key part of Hyundai’s India operations since it entered the country. He said the company continues to be the largest exporter among auto manufacturers in India on a cumulative basis. He said, “exports have been a great driver.”Hyundai Motor India reported single-digit growth in revenue and operating profit on a year-on-year basis for the October–December 2025 quarter. The company continues to focus on balancing domestic sales and exports to support growth.The company currently has a market capitalisation of ₹1,78,954.05 crore. Its shares have gained more than 18% over the last year.These are the edited excerpts of the interview.Q: In January, the volumes rose to close to 12%, with the highest ever monthly sales. Could you tell us how quarter four is shaping up so far?A: I think it's a very positive sign. And we can see positive momentum everywhere. Thanks to goods and services tax  2.0, we saw in the October to December quarter also a lot of retail momentum. And what happened was because we were able to make space in the network inventory, January also started on a very positive note, and we are seeing growth across segments.For example, Aura clocked the highest ever sales. The new Venue has received a great response, almost 80,000 bookings and highest ever sales again, Creta continues to be very strong, so I think we can be much more positive about quarter four. I don't like to put a number to it, but as things stand now, the momentum seems to be very strong.Q: Most brokerages have raised their passenger vehicle  industry outlook, especially post the recent volume upmove that has happened. What's your own estimate for the industry? Not particularly for you. What's your own estimate for FY27?A: In fact, now we are already at the end of FY26, and it's better to talk about even FY27, and we had a Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers  conclave where all the auto original equipment manufacturers  were present, and the consensus was about 5 to 6% growth for the industry. I'm sure Hyundai would like to beat that.Also Read | Bajaj Auto sees export run-rate holding above 2 lakh units a monthAnd like I said, the calendar year has started on a very positive note. And we believe that, because the growth is everywhere, and the maximum growth is coming in the compact SUV segment, where the new Venue has received a great response, and we are looking at avenues to increase the production further, because we have a great backlog of orders. So, we can sustain this kind of momentum going forward in FY26–27 also. And as we already announced in the investor day, our new model has already kicked in with the Venue, and more models will come in. I think all that should help us to carry this momentum to the next fiscal.Q: You reported an increase in realisation of around 3%. I assume you've taken a price hike. If you could give us some clarity on that particular aspect.A: If you see the last quarter, in January 2025 we had a price increase of about 0.7%, and obviously that effect has helped until December - October to December quarter. And obviously we had some very strong cost optimisation measures. We have a very strong quality of growth strategy. Even post GST, we were very disciplined in our discount levels, which remained less than 3%.So, all in all, all these factors have helped us to have growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation  margins and growth in topline as well as in bottom line. Exports also helped. We had a 21% growth in exports last quarter on a year-on-year  basis. And I think exports continue to be a very strong pillar in HMI’s quest for volume and profitability.Q: Since you spoke about profitability, let's talk about the margins. Will it stay around this 11.2–11.3% sort of band despite commodity inflation?A: During our Investor Day, we have already given guidance that our EBITDA margins will stay between 11% and 14%, and we are fairly confident of meeting those expectations going forward as well.Q: Is there another price hike on the anvil?A: Ideally, we don't want to do price hikes, and we always try to do cost optimisation. So, we'll watch the commodity prices, we'll see what the pressures are, and we'll take a decision as and when required. But obviously, the endeavour is always to avoid price hikes as much as possible, to do cost optimisation and other measures in terms of saving cost or localisation or the trim strategy, the quality of sales strategy. So, I think that will continue to be our endeavour going forward as well, unless it becomes imperative to pass on some of the cost to the customers. But let's see.We will watch the commodity prices. The volatility is so high. You have seen how things are moving, especially precious metals. So, I think we need to have a close watch on that.Q: Exports have been a growth driver, and you briefly mentioned them in the past. Could you tell us what's the strategy with regard to exports from here on?A: We have headroom because of the additional capacity in the Pune plant. So, we have accelerated on the exports. We are Hyundai Motor Company’s  hub outside of Korea for the emerging markets. The new Venue is produced exclusively in India. This will present some new opportunities for us. The Middle East is doing very well in exports, Latin America as well. The new model cycle is kicking in. So we look at those models also helping us in exports.In the mid-term, all these FTAs are also very exciting, and we still need to go through the details — India-EU, whether there is any opportunity there. So, we'll be very open and positive. The demographics of India, a very strong plant structure, and a very high level of quality put us in a very good position to continuously look for opportunities for increasing exports.Also Read | PG Electroplast holds FY26 target, waits for channel inventory to clear, summer salesHyundai has been very strong in India in terms of exporting since the time we set foot in India. On a cumulative basis, we still hold the position of being the number one exporter. And in the last 12 to 15 months, exports have been a great driver. Already, we have announced that from the current level of 23 to 24% contribution of exports to overall production, we intend to go to 30%. So, the plans are very much intact, and we are fairly confident that exports will only go up from here.Q: Since you spoke about increased capacity helping your exports, could you tell us what your current capacity utilisation is, and when do you get to this 30% contribution coming in from exports?A: The current capacity is now almost 824,000 in Chennai and 170,000 in Pune. So, 994,000 is our capacity. So, we have enough capacity now. And that 30% is, of course, for FY30. So that is a long-term plan. The current level is about 23 to 24%.Q: Lastly, could you talk to us about the strategy behind the foray into the commercial mobility segment?A: I think this is a very interesting segment, and we have seen the segment really grow, especially post COVID, in the last three to four years, when people are looking for shared mobility. So, I think Hyundai is a strong brand and has very strong products, along with the factory-fitted CNG option, both in the hatchback as well as in the sedan segment. So, we've introduced it in January. The initial response is very encouraging, especially in the sedan segment. That has helped us clock the highest ever Aura sales.And overall, the products are very reliable. We have a very comprehensive strategy. It's not only about the product. Our dealers are ready. We are tying up with financiers. The service packages are there to give comfort to the operators. So, we are fairly confident that we will be able to make a strong mark in this segment, where the competition is not very strong and very few players have the right product to tap this taxi segment.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation  is fairly strong, but a large part of that has to do with the deconsolidation of the sports business and some of the acquisitions that you've made over the course of the last year as well. So organically, excluding all the acquisitions and deconsolidation, on a like-to-like basis, what has been the revenue and profitability growth for you?A: So, revenue growth is 10%. Profitability growth would be upwards of 25%. But just to take a step back, the revenue decline at the headline number is typically because of the deconsolidation. Our focus on core gaming continues to progress very well. And our EBITDA margins in this quarter have increased significantly to 16.8%. So, we're very much on the right track. We are executing what we said we would execute, and the numbers are tracking what we expect.Q: One of the positives was with regard to Kiddopia and the resumption of subscriptions and subscribers. There were many quarters where we saw a decline, and now that's picked up. What's the outlook from here on? Does this addition continue? And would you say the worst is behind for the Kiddopia business?A: Fundamentally, since last year, we have created these centres of excellence in user acquisition, in data analytics, in artificial intelligence  and product. What the centres of excellence are doing is supporting each of our games and our studios to enhance the way they are operating. And the first positive impact, and tangible impact, you can see is in Kiddopia.We were struggling to add to the subscriber base for quite some time, and this quarter we've been able to show a net positive impact. And the best part is that our cost per acquisition has come down from $37 to $35.4, so we've been able to spend more but at lower costs, which makes us feel that we can get growth going strongly in the coming quarters.Also Read | A made-in-India global gaming powerhouse: CEO Nitish Mittersain's ambition for NazaraQ: In terms of the investments that you're making in the business so far, what has been the total dollar value of investments that you've made in the company so far, and will you be making more? Are you looking at some sort of shareholder fundraising?A: We are continuing to invest, one, organically in our existing businesses. That is very important. If you see any of our games, like Animal Jam has been launched on Roblox.We've signed new licences for TV shows globally. We recently launched a Big Brother game. There's a lot of investment that's going into existing business, and we are also actively pursuing new acquisitions of gaming studios, and continue to be in advanced talks with a few, so that may happen. I think we will continue with these new centres of excellence that we have created. A good part of that is that they will support all these studios that we acquire and add a lot of synergy and value to them.Q: The dollar value of total investments that you've made in the company so far — because organic growth is at around 10% — one sense is that you'll be raising funds for funding growth going forward. So, you will be using shareholders' money to buy growth. That's the point here. So, if you could give us the dollar value of the investment.A: Over many years, we would have invested a lot of capital. But in the last year, we did two key acquisitions — Fusebox Games and WildWorks. Between the two, we invested capital of about ₹500 crore or less. Currently, the company has about ₹700 crore worth of net cash on its balance sheet. And if we require additional capital, we will raise capital.What we are very focused on is to ensure that if there is any capital raise and there is dilution to the shareholders, the accretion in terms of cash flows from the businesses that we acquire is far more rewarding than the dilution. So, we are very conscious of that. The one metric we are looking at is cash flow per share. It should be significantly improved by any action that we take.Q: And if you're doing a dilution, what could it be to the tune of? Will it be ₹500 crore, ₹800 crore, or ₹1,000 crore kind of dilution?A: If we do, perhaps in that range. But there is nothing final at this point in time.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

The growth in every sector related to GCCs, as well as if you look at now, even with the Budget, with the AI and the data centre companies, and this solutioning that is going to provide tax holidays is only going to help and improve the sector.Q: You have 152,000 seats, when do we expect this number to double from here?A: So last year, we added about 40,000 seats. So, 32,000 for this year, next year, we will provide that guidance in the next quarter itself.Q: Since you said you are at the highest level of commercial rentals, even volumes and pricing are going in tandem, so I wanted to understand, what would the risk to some of the big opportunities that there are in the industry currently? So, the growth engines and the drivers for co-working, overall, for commercial real estate, are very strong.For co-working, it's a first port of call, especially for the first time GCCs, they do not have their teams in India, and as a result, co-working and flex provides a great solutioning. But I think there is a very clear approach that we are taking where we have to balance the seat addition with the growth and the profitability at the same time.If you look at our numbers, we did about ₹22 crores of PAT at this point, and for the year or nine month period, we are almost ₹50 crores of PAT.",

Also, now if you have more clarity on FY27 as well, because we are almost done with FY26 what kind of seat additions, revenue growth and margin outlook are you looking at?A: The guidance for FY26 continues to remain what we had given originally about a 30% growth for the overall business. As you see in the nine month period, the co-working and allied services grew much faster, at about almost 38% and for the quarter as well, it grew at about 32% so continuing to see great growth momentum in our co-working business.Also, for FY27 at this point, I would not like to comment. We will give that guidance in the quarter four results, because we are still planning our annual operating plan there. The sector overall seems extremely bullish. The growth in every sector related to GCCs, as well as if you look at now, even with the Budget, with the AI and the data centre companies, and this solutioning that is going to provide tax holidays is only going to help and improve the sector.Q: You have 152,000 seats, when do we expect this number to double from here?A: So last year, we added about 40,000 seats. This year, our seat addition is about 32,000 and that's specifically because, we are at the highest cycle of the commercial real estate in terms of rentals, so we have been a bit cautious about it. Again, our growth targets remain the same, but we were a bit cautious. So, 32,000 for this year, next year, we will provide that guidance in the next quarter itself.Q: Since you said you are at the highest level of commercial rentals, even volumes and pricing are going in tandem, so I wanted to understand, what would the risk to some of the big opportunities that there are in the industry currently? Would it be pricing decline? Would it be volume decline? How are you seeing the industry shape up going forward since we have seen a big surge already?A: The industry bases a lot of things that have gone in the macro environment, the trade deal happened, the budget was very supportive of foreign investments coming in the GCC boom. I mean, if you look at the GCCs, there are about 2,900 GCCs every quarter. We are adding 25 to 30 new GCCs. Projection is by 2030 we would have close to about 4,500 GCCs employing 2.8 million people from 1.5 million today. So, the growth engines and the drivers for co-working, overall, for commercial real estate, are very strong.For co-working, it's a first port of call, especially for the first time GCCs, they do not have their teams in India, and as a result, co-working and flex provides a great solutioning. Today, we have been able to do 12 GCCs, first time GCCs, 11 more on pipeline. If you look at the overall revenue, 21% of our revenue comes from GCCs, which is about 80 plus companies in our portfolio today. So, very bullish overall, for the sector and as well as for our own growthQ: If you can tell us, how long does it take for a new centre to breakeven? And considering that, 32,000 to 40,000 on an annual basis, do you think next three years we can look at three lakh seats for Awfis?A: We would want to obviously grow in that direction. But I think there is a very clear approach that we are taking where we have to balance the seat addition with the growth and the profitability at the same time.If you look at our numbers, we did about ₹22 crores of PAT at this point, and for the year or nine month period, we are almost ₹50 crores of PAT. For us, balancing the two decent amount of growth, 25-30% while balancing seat addition is very critical. If you look at our even today's seats that we have added, it's enough for us to demonstrate 25 to 30% growth through FY27. Exact guidance we will give, but today we still have seat capacity to fill, which will allow us to grow at that pace.Catch all the stock market live updates hereFollow our live blog for more updates on Q3 results",

The India-US trade deal took a positive step, with the US reducing the tariff on India’s exports to 18 per cent and doing away with the penal tariff of 25 per cent, said Kotak Institutional Equities, with expecting markets to react positively with some near-term appreciation bias for the Indian rupee on the back of positive sentiments and flows. While details are awaited, reports suggest that India will have to remove their tariff and non-tariff barriers, commit to more imports from the US in addition to the current levels and stop buying Russian crude oil,\" it added. Ventura Securities has picked Gokaldas Exports, Welspun Living, Indo Count Industries, KPR Mills, Trident, Arvind, Vardhman Textiles, Bharat Forge, Samvardhana Motherson International, Sona Comstar, Sundaram Finance, Balkrishna Industries, JK Tyres, Avanti Feeds, Apex Frozen Waterbase, Sky Gold, Vaibhav Global, Goldiam International as key beneficiaries of the trade deal .

        "full_content": "India's recent tariff relief from the United States (US) has strengthened the country's role in global exports, closely following the finalisation of the European trade agreement. The India-US trade deal is expected to drive substantial growth for Indian exports, especially in sectors like textiles, apparel, and electronics, as Ventura Securities highlights.\nThe dual agreements—described as \"the India-EU Free Trade Agreement (the Mother of all deals) and the India-US Trade Deal (the 'Father of all deals')—have fundamentally altered India's trade structure. For sectors with high export dependence, such as textiles, chemicals, and auto ancillaries, the changes signal immediate margin improvements and long-term opportunities.\nThe India-US trade deal took a positive step, with the US reducing the tariff on India’s exports to 18 per cent and doing away with the penal tariff of 25 per cent, said Kotak Institutional Equities, with expecting markets to react positively with some near-term appreciation bias for the Indian rupee on the back of positive sentiments and flows.\nWhile details are awaited, reports suggest that India will have to remove their tariff and non-tariff barriers, commit to more imports from the US in addition to the current levels and stop buying Russian crude oil,\" it added. \"Indian producers or tariff rates are relatively low, though some risks remain for auto parts, iron/steel, plastics and chemicals.\"\nAccording to Ventura Securities, this development brings a competitive 18% reciprocal tariff with the US—which effectively scraps the 25% 'Russian oil penalty'—and achieving zero duty access for 99% of exports to the EU. This positions India as a favoured alternative to Chinese and Southeast Asian supply chains.\nVentura Securities notes that most key players are already operating at 75–90% capacity utilisation, and with reduced trade barriers, the industry is likely to enter a significant 'Brownfield' expansion phase. Export-dependent companies are expected to benefit most from tariff relief, particularly those with substantial US market exposure.\nMajor competitors remain leading Chinese and Southeast Asian firms, but the new deals may shift the competitive landscape in favour of Indian producers. Ventura Securities observes that the current environment is set for substantial expansion across export-driven segments, as regulatory changes and improved market access begin to influence company strategies and sector returns.\nVentura Securities has picked Gokaldas Exports, Welspun Living, Indo Count Industries, KPR Mills, Trident, Arvind, Vardhman Textiles, Bharat Forge, Samvardhana Motherson International, Sona Comstar, Sundaram Finance, Balkrishna Industries, JK Tyres, Avanti Feeds, Apex Frozen Waterbase, Sky Gold, Vaibhav Global, Goldiam International as key beneficiaries of the trade deal .\nIt also sees Aarti Industries, Vinati Organics, SRF, Navin Fluorine, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, PI Industries, Mirza International, Mayur Uniquoters, Superhouse and Bhartiya International as other key beneficiaries . All these companies have up to 90 per cent experts to the US or European nations.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today. India Today Group.",

Live Events -- YES Securities pegs the net loss at Rs 2,208 crore weighed down by sharp YoY decline in JLR earnings. -- JM Financial is the most cautious, forecasting net losses of Rs 4,549 crore. -- Deven Choksey Research is the only brokerage among the four which estimates TMPV to report a profit, albeit 18% lower on YoY basis at Rs 446 crore. 2) Revenues -- Nuvama estimates consolidated revenues at Rs 69,023 crore, down 27% YoY and 5% QoQ, as JLR production disruptions offset robust India PV growth. -- YES Securities sees revenue at Rs 68,447 crore, down 5.4% QoQ, with a steep YoY decline driven by JLR. -- JM Financial expects revenues of Rs 67,094 crore, down 29% YoY and 8.3% QoQ. -- Deven Choksey Research pegs PV revenues at Rs 10,218 crore, down 9.3% YoY and 41.2% QoQ. 3) EBITDA Nuvama forecasts EBITDA of just Rs 374 crore, down 97% YoY, citing higher variable marketing expenses (VME) and lower operating leverage at JLR. -- YES Securities estimates EBITDA at Rs 1,490 crore, with partial recovery in margins QoQ. -- JM Financial expects EBITDA losses of Rs 794 crore, reflecting continued stress at JLR. -- Deven Choksey Research estimates PV EBITDA at Rs 1,174 crore, down 5.4% YoY. 4) EBITDA margin -- Nuvama expects EBITDA margin to compress sharply to 0.5%, down 1,275 bps YoY and 248 bps QoQ, led by weak JLR scale and higher costs. -- YES Securities sees consolidated EBITDA margins recovering modestly to around 2.2%, though still well below historical levels due to JLR headwinds. 5) Volume Deven Choksey Research estimates PV volumes at 3,60,472 units, up 6% YoY and a sharp 71.2% QoQ, supported by festive demand, GST 2.0-led revival and launches such as the Sierra. 6) Key monitorables JLR demand and production outlook post the cyber-attack disruption remains key monitorables, said both Nuvama and JM Financial. Meanwhile, margin recovery trajectory at JLR, including the pace of volume ramp-up and VME normalization also remain in focus, opines YES Securities.

Aggressive bidding by smaller players in Green Ammonia, Hydrogen, and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) auctions has led to prices considered unsustainable for profitable execution.\nDiscussions with Advait Energy and JSW Energy indicated that several government tenders, including the latest, are unlikely to be feasible for bidders under current conditions. On the BESS front, standalone tariffs have dropped sharply from about Rs 280,000 per MW per month in early 2025 to around Rs 150,000 per MW per month recently. This rapid decline may cause delays as power purchasers reconsider previously contracted prices in light of lower tariffs.\nB&K Securities noted the risk of a 'winner’s curse' and cautioned that these aggressive tariff levels could ultimately result in losses for developers unable to deliver profitably.\nAnother issue raised is the backlog of around 42 GW of solar Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that remain unsigned, largely due to last-mile evacuation delays. The figure represents a cumulative build-up over years, mainly caused by delays in commissioning central transmission utility substations needed to connect projects to the main grid.\nTenders for renewable generation and grid substations are often awarded separately, and any delay in substation commissioning leads to cost overruns. Developers may have to rely on higher-cost state transmission networks, costs that distribution companies are unwilling to bear.

Grid stability and resilience will become an important theme in the coming decade This should be positive for Siemens Energy, GEV T&D and Hitachi Energy,\" B&K Securities adds.\nSuzlon Energy Suzlon Energy is India’s largest wind turbine OEM and is positioned to benefit from the country’s accelerating wind energy deployment. The company reiterated that renewable energy is essential for India’s long-term self-sufficiency, and wind remains a structurally important pillar given India’s resource abundance.\nThe S144 turbine platform has been designed specifically to generate electricity efficiently even in low-wind zones, expanding the addressable market. The company expects installations to reach ~1,500 units in FY27, implying a strong growth ramp-up. Suzlon believes that larger MW turbines will drive further technological improvement by enhancing efficiency and addressing land-scarcity constraints.\nWaaree Clean Energy Solutions Waaree is expanding into the green hydrogen ecosystem through electrolyser manufacturing, positioning itself early in an emerging decarbonization value chain. It believes green hydrogen adoption is still at a nascent stage, although hydrogen remains a fundamental input across industrial processes.\nThe company expects green hydrogen economics to converge toward parity with grey hydrogen over the next few years, enabling broader adoption. Waaree has entered into a technology tie-up with a Chinese partner and is currently focused on manufacturing alkaline electrolysers, given their inherent cost advantage over PEM systems.\nSiemens Energy India Siemens Energy India is a critical supplier of FACTS systems and grid-stabilisation technologies that will become increasingly essential as renewable penetration rises. STATCOM demand is currently concentrated in the Gujarat-Rajasthan renewable corridor. Management estimates that every 1 GW of renewable addition requires roughly 300 MVAr of STATCOM capacity to stabilise grid operations.\nPraj Industries Praj Industries is expanding from ethanol into renewable chemicals, bioplastics and SAF technology licencing. It demonstrated Poly-lactic acid (PLA) technology through a 100 tpa lactic acid plant and is offering this as a licensable solution. Balrampur Chini Mills is the first large-scale customer, licencing Praj’s technology for ~55 tpa lactic acid production.\nTorrent Electricals Torrent Electricals is scaling rapidly in the HV/EHV cable segment, supported by structural transmission capex tailwinds. The company is venturing aggressively into HV and EHV cables and is already gaining market share in these categories. Cables remain a scale-driven business, where margins are largely determined by raw material procurement discipline and operating leverage.\nReNew Energy Global ReNew is among India’s largest renewable IPPs with a diversified operating portfolio across solar, wind and hydro. It is increasingly scaling its upstream manufacturing presence to strengthen integration and reduce import dependence. It currently operates 11 GW of renewable capacity and has another 8-9 GW under-construction, providing strong multi-year growth visibility.\nThyssenkrupp Industries India Thyssenkrupp is a leading provider of industrial boiler systems in India, offering full EPC solutions across large-scale thermal and process applications. It primarily focuses on industrial boilers ranging from 50 TPH to 1,000 TPH, with demand coming largely from industrial processes and chemical industries.\nSolar Turbines Solar Turbines is a global leader in mid-sized industrial gas turbines, with strong relevance in distributed energy and industrial captive power applications. It manufactures gas turbines in the 1-35 MW range and holds a leading global market position in this segment. Management indicated that the US remains the primary market for Solar Turbines.\nAdvait Energy Advait Energy is participating in early-stage green hydrogen tenders, though economics remain immature and pricing highly competitive.

And specifically, in unsecured, how much headroom do you have, given some of the asset quality pressures that lenders have been telling us seem to have abated?A: We have always concentrated more on the secured front, starting with the MSMEs, commercial trading, and we added secured retail, particularly housing loans, loan against the property , rental discounting and all.So, from 2024 onwards, we have started building up the team, and around the end of the calendar year , we were able to see growth improving. And we have not gone in a significant way, unsecured retail, so far, and that strategy will stay for many more quarters to come before, if at all, we see on that line.Also Read: Budget 2026 | PSU bank mergers, capital rule changes on the table as India aims for bigger global banks: DFS SecretaryBut as of now, we are going purely on secured lending on MSMEs, commercial trading, gold loans and agriculture, along with now the secured retail of, let’s say, housing loans, LAP and other things.So, we feel we are spending some time on setting up the team. So, could you give us a sense of margins, based on all these factors?A: As you rightly said, we started fixed-rate gold loans a year before last, and the entire gold loan portfolio has, by and large, converted into a fixed-rate portfolio already. As we discussed in the con-call, over the next two to three quarters, whatever term deposits are maturing and repricing at lower rates, we will get the benefit to compensate for whatever yield reduction is happening on the asset side because of the repo cut.So overall, we are confident that whatever margin we currently have is sustainable, with a plus or minus 10 basis points.Q: The credit-deposit  ratio is at 86%, are you comfortable with that and your guidance for what kind of deposit growth would you have?A: The deposit growth will definitely be in tune with the credit growth, so that there will not be any stoppage in credit because of the non-availability of deposits.",

And we never had a concept of a sales team in our bank in the past. It’s only in the last couple of years that we have been verticalising these business lines, and the sales units and all are now set, and they have started delivering.In fact, we said a year before last that last year it would make a loss. And for 2025-26 , it would start breaking even. And then from next year onwards, it would start adding to profitability. In fact, it has started adding to profitability this year, slightly ahead of whatever we had.Q: Margins were a key positive in this result as well. How much of that is sustainable, because part of it is because of your gold loans being made fixed-rate? How much repricing is left? And even deposit repricing is something you have done. So, could you give us a sense of margins, based on all these factors?A: As you rightly said, we started fixed-rate gold loans a year before last, and the entire gold loan portfolio has, by and large, converted into a fixed-rate portfolio already. So, we do not expect any shock.At the same time, the repo rate cut pass-through happened only towards the end of the quarter. So, the impact because of that will be slightly higher in terms of reduction in yields on advances.Also Read: Chola Securities backs PSU banks, cautious on private lenders and midcap cementAt the same time, it will get compensated. As we discussed in the con-call, over the next two to three quarters, whatever term deposits are maturing and repricing at lower rates, we will get the benefit to compensate for whatever yield reduction is happening on the asset side because of the repo cut.So overall, we are confident that whatever margin we currently have is sustainable, with a plus or minus 10 basis points.Q: The credit-deposit  ratio is at 86%, are you comfortable with that and your guidance for what kind of deposit growth would you have?A: The deposit growth will definitely be in tune with the credit growth, so that there will not be any stoppage in credit because of the non-availability of deposits. Consistently, we have maintained that we are comfortable with a CD ratio of about 85% to 86%, and we are in that range currently.Watch the interview in the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

Sinha said, “Exact launch dates are not yet known.” He said the company is working to bring launches forward where possible.Mahindra Lifespace has guided for residential pre-sales of about ₹4,500 to ₹5,000 crore in the next financial year. The company said early launches will help support sales momentum. Sinha said, “We’ve given guidance of ₹4,500 to ₹5,000 crore for our pre-sales.”The company reported its earnings for the October–December 2025 quarter, supported by a recovery in residential sales and demand in its industrial and integrated cities business.Mahindra Lifespace currently has a market capitalisation of ₹7,970.49 crore. The company’s shares have declined by more than 1% over the past year.These are the edited excerpts of the interview.Q: There's an increase in quarter three bookings and volumes as well. But if I look at the nine-month sales, they have come in at ₹1,773 crore. FY25 sales were at ₹2,800 crore. Do you think you'll be able to surpass last year's bookings, considering that the quarterly run rate so far has been around ₹500 crore?A: We will be able to surpass our last year's numbers and hopefully show growth. Some part of that is driven by the launches. We had, as an example, a very successful launch of a project called Mahindra Blossom in Whitefield, Bengaluru, and in the three days of the last weekend, it did more than ₹1,000 crore itself. So, we are hoping to see growth driven by some of these launches. So, one of them is Mahindra Blossom.Also Read | Hyundai Motor India plans to lift exports share to 30% of production by FY30We are expecting a couple of other launches to come through, but more importantly, for the launches that we did in the early part of the year, as well as the phase launches of the previous projects, which will give us growth momentum. We see opportunities across all our markets — Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Pune. And these launches are just evidence to show that there is momentum in the market for our kind of products, for our value proposition.Q: Could you quantify these launch numbers for us? And how much in Q4, and how much would come in FY27?A: We are looking at maybe two to three big launches coming in the next three months, and I'm not constraining it by the end of the financial year, because sometimes launches spill over the March 31 deadline. But we have roughly anywhere from ₹7,000 to ₹8,000 crore worth of launches that are going to happen towards the end of quarter four and the start of quarter one.Combining some of that — exact dates and exact launch dates are not yet known. We are pushing hard to get them sooner, but this is very important, because for the next year, I've given guidance of ₹4,500 to ₹5,000 crore for our pre-sales on the residential side, and that's something that we are looking forward to by having these launches lined up in the early part of the next financial year. Hopefully, some of the quarter four launches will have a positive effect on the pre-sales velocity next year.Q: The big talking point, of course, has to be demand trends. The realty index is coming off the 52-week high. Many stocks are at lows as well. Do you think we are towards the latter part of the real estate upcycle?A: I wish I knew the perfect answer to that. But let me give you three points here. The first point is that there are some signs of moderation in the market, especially in certain segments and certain micro markets or specific cities. For example, in NCR, we see a significant slowdown. We see a slowdown in the luxury segment. There are markets that have this characteristic.But overall, if you look at inventory overhang — how much inventory is there in the market that customers can buy — it has moved up only 10%, from 13 months to now close to 15 months. That means if no new launches are coming into the market, all the inventory that is there will get absorbed in 15 months. It was 13 months two years back. So, it hasn't been a very significant shift on the inventory overhang side, but there are certain pockets and segments where you see a slowdown.Also Read | Nazara Technologies says core business improving, more acquisitions on radarThe second is that we need to be clear where we play, and it's good that we are present in Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru.The third part is, as things slow down — and we expect some part of it to happen and then get corrected over a longer period — there is a shift towards branded developers, and quality developers who have a multi-year track record, who have always met customer expectations, and delivered projects on time in line with expectations.

Total income for Q3 stood at ₹1,655 crore, compared to ₹1,520 crore in the same quarter last year.\nThe quarterly profit growth was driven by a 16 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) rise in advances,  on the back of MSME loans and fixed-rate gold loans, which also helped improve yield on advances. Total advances as of December 2025 stood at ₹50,763 crore.\nDeposits grew 12.5 per cent y-o-y to ₹56,707 crore. Total business grew by 14.3 per cent y-o-y to ₹1,07,470 crore as of December 2025. The bank also saw a healthy CASA increase to ₹15,847 crore with a growth rate of 14.9 per cent on y-o-y basis.\n“We are on a transformation journey, and have seen growth momentum further accelerating in this quarter with growth in total business, profitability and reaching highest-ever quarterly net profit levels,” Salee S Nair, MD & CEO, Tamilnad Mercantile Bank Ltd, told media persons. For full fiscal FY26, the bank expects to grow total business by over 15 per cent, a tad higher than their original guidance.\nThe MSME loan segment growth, especially, has been a “turnaround story”, said the MD and CEO. We expect the recent US and EU trade deals as a definite boost to this segment, he added. A robust 60 per cent+ growth in personal gold loans portfolio (secured), which help shield banks from the impact of ‘repo rate cuts’ have also helped, he noted.\nOn the asset quality front, Gross NPA has decreased to 0.91 per cent in Q3FY26 from 1.32 per cent in Q3FY25. Net NPA has decreased to 0.20 per cent, improved by 21 bps y-o-y.\nAmong other digital initiatives, helping the bank improve CASA and collections, TMB said it has established a “state-of-the-art Call Centre with AI calling facility” to enhance customer service and support capabilities. We expect to set aside around ₹250 crore for technology modernisation and digital transformation in FY27, along the same lines as FY26, Nair said.\nBased on the bank’s preliminary assessment, it does not see the incremental impact of new Labour Codes to be material on the finances, and accordingly no provision is considered for the quarter.\nPublished on  February 4, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\nNilesh Jain, VP- Equity Technical & Derivative Research at Centrum Broking\nHero MotoCorp| CMP: Rs 5,851.5\nHero MotoCorp has broken out of a falling channel on the daily chart and has also decisively moved above its 50-DMA at Rs 5,836. With this breakout, it is now trading well above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating sustained strength.\nFrom a derivatives perspective, the addition of fresh long positions, with open interest rising by around 6 percent, further reinforces the positive bias.\nConsidering the overall technical setup, a conservative upside target is placed near the Rs 6,300 level in the near term, while crucial support is seen at Rs 5,670.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 6,300\nStop-Loss: Rs 5,670\nSarda Energy & Minerals| CMP: Rs 521.35\nSarda Energy has registered a fresh breakout from a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart. The sharp price up-move is accompanied by a notable surge in volumes, which validates the bullish breakout. Earlier, the stock had formed a double-bottom pattern near the Rs 455 level and witnessed a strong rebound from that base.\nMomentum indicators are also aligned with the positive bias, as the RSI has moved above the 60 mark and the MACD has generated a bullish crossover, signalling improving upside momentum. Overall, the technical structure indicates that the stock is well positioned to move toward the Rs 555 level in the near term, while immediate support at the 200-DMA is placed near Rs 499.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 555\nStop-Loss: Rs 499\nCCL Products| CMP: Rs 1,002.85\nCCL Products (India) has witnessed a strong breakout from an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart. The move is backed by higher-than-average volumes, lending credibility to the breakout and highlighting strong buying interest. Additionally, the stock is trading firmly above all its short-term moving averages, which reinforces the bullish momentum.\nBased on the pattern projection, the potential upside target is placed around the Rs 1,075 level, while the neckline near Rs 961 is likely to act as an important support zone on any pullback.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 1,075\nStop-Loss: Rs 961\nSudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities\nSteel Authority of India| CMP: Rs 157.29\nSAIL has staged a strong rebound from its 50-day EMA, reinforcing the prevailing uptrend. On the daily chart, the stock continues to form a higher top–higher bottom structure, signalling sustained bullishness. The RSI has bounced from 53 to 62, reflecting improving momentum. The DI+ crossover above DI- on the ADX indicator highlights strengthening trend support.\nWith prices holding near the upper Bollinger Band, the stock appears well positioned to extend its upward move in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 158–156 with a stop-loss at Rs 152. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 168 level in the short term.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 168\nStop-Loss: Rs 152\nMax Financial Services| CMP: Rs 1,708.2\nMax Financial Services has rebounded sharply from its key upward-sloping trendline support, drawn by connecting the lows of Rs 1,451 and Rs 1,502 formed on August 4 and October 27, 2025, respectively.

The RSI has surged from 31 to 60 in just seven sessions, signalling strong bullish momentum.\nThe DI+ crossover above DI- on the ADX indicates bulls gaining control, while the MACD has crossed above its signal line, supporting further upside potential.

The Infra index has moved from the lagging to the improving quadrant on the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG), highlighting improving sector-wide momentum, with L&T leading the move.\nStrong price action and sectoral momentum suggest the stock is well placed to extend its uptrend. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 4,090–4,050 with a stop-loss at Rs 3,920.

        "full_content": "Equity benchmarks extended their uptrend for the third consecutive session, with the Nifty 50 rising 0.2 percent amid healthy market breadth on February 5. A total of 2,012 shares saw buying interest compared to 911 shares that were backed by bears. Consolidation with range-bound trading may continue over the next couple of sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\nNilesh Jain, VP- Equity Technical & Derivative Research at Centrum Broking\nHero MotoCorp| CMP: Rs 5,851.5\nHero MotoCorp has broken out of a falling channel on the daily chart and has also decisively moved above its 50-DMA at Rs 5,836. With this breakout, it is now trading well above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating sustained strength.\nFrom a derivatives perspective, the addition of fresh long positions, with open interest rising by around 6 percent, further reinforces the positive bias.\nConsidering the overall technical setup, a conservative upside target is placed near the Rs 6,300 level in the near term, while crucial support is seen at Rs 5,670.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 6,300\nStop-Loss: Rs 5,670\nSarda Energy & Minerals| CMP: Rs 521.35\nSarda Energy has registered a fresh breakout from a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart. The sharp price up-move is accompanied by a notable surge in volumes, which validates the bullish breakout. Earlier, the stock had formed a double-bottom pattern near the Rs 455 level and witnessed a strong rebound from that base.\nMomentum indicators are also aligned with the positive bias, as the RSI has moved above the 60 mark and the MACD has generated a bullish crossover, signalling improving upside momentum. Overall, the technical structure indicates that the stock is well positioned to move toward the Rs 555 level in the near term, while immediate support at the 200-DMA is placed near Rs 499.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 555\nStop-Loss: Rs 499\nCCL Products| CMP: Rs 1,002.85\nCCL Products (India) has witnessed a strong breakout from an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart. The move is backed by higher-than-average volumes, lending credibility to the breakout and highlighting strong buying interest. Additionally, the stock is trading firmly above all its short-term moving averages, which reinforces the bullish momentum.\nBased on the pattern projection, the potential upside target is placed around the Rs 1,075 level, while the neckline near Rs 961 is likely to act as an important support zone on any pullback.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 1,075\nStop-Loss: Rs 961\nSudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities\nSteel Authority of India| CMP: Rs 157.29\nSAIL has staged a strong rebound from its 50-day EMA, reinforcing the prevailing uptrend. On the daily chart, the stock continues to form a higher top–higher bottom structure, signalling sustained bullishness. The RSI has bounced from 53 to 62, reflecting improving momentum. The DI+ crossover above DI- on the ADX indicator highlights strengthening trend support.\nWith prices holding near the upper Bollinger Band, the stock appears well positioned to extend its upward move in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 158–156 with a stop-loss at Rs 152. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 168 level in the short term.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 168\nStop-Loss: Rs 152\nMax Financial Services| CMP: Rs 1,708.2\nMax Financial Services has rebounded sharply from its key upward-sloping trendline support, drawn by connecting the lows of Rs 1,451 and Rs 1,502 formed on August 4 and October 27, 2025, respectively. The stock now trades above its key short- and long-term moving averages. The RSI has surged from 31 to 60 in just seven sessions, signalling strong bullish momentum.\nThe DI+ crossover above DI- on the ADX indicates bulls gaining control, while the MACD has crossed above its signal line, supporting further upside potential. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,715–1,705 with a stop-loss at Rs 1,660. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 1,830 level in the short term.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 1,830\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,660\nLarsen & Toubro| CMP: Rs 4,087.1\nLarsen & Toubro has staged a strong rebound from its 200-day EMA on the daily chart, signalling a shift in trend. The RSI has recovered sharply from an oversold level of 24 to 61, indicating strengthening bullish momentum. Rising MACD histogram bars further support the positive bias. The Infra index has moved from the lagging to the improving quadrant on the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG), highlighting improving sector-wide momentum, with L&T leading the move.\nStrong price action and sectoral momentum suggest the stock is well placed to extend its uptrend. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 4,090–4,050 with a stop-loss at Rs 3,920. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 4,400 level in the short term.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 4,400\nStop-Loss: Rs 3,920\nRupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities\nHindalco Industries| CMP: Rs 965\nHindalco Industries has been sustaining above the 20 EMA after a brief corrective move. On the hourly chart, it has witnessed a consolidation breakout, indicating improving optimism. The hourly RSI is in a bullish crossover, pointing to positive momentum.\nOn the upside, the stock may move towards Rs 1,020. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 939; a breach below this level could weaken the trend.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 1,020\nStop-Loss: Rs 939\nMahindra and Mahindra Financial Services| CMP: Rs 370\nMahindra & Mahindra Financial Services has formed a piercing line pattern on the daily chart, indicating the possibility of a bullish reversal. It continues to sustain above the 50 EMA on the daily timeframe.\nThe RSI is in a bullish crossover and is trending higher, reflecting strengthening momentum. On the upside, the stock may move towards the Rs 385–400 zone. On the downside, support is placed at Rs 358; a break below this level could weaken the trend.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 385, Rs 400\nStop-Loss: Rs 358\nCaplin Point Laboratories| CMP: Rs 1,909.5\nCaplin Point Laboratories has undergone a healthy consolidation on the daily chart, suggesting rising optimism. Additionally, it has been sustaining above the 20 EMA.

        "full_content": "Shares of Indian IT companies slumped on February 4 after US artificial intelligence firm Anthropic’s launch of a legal AI tool reignited fears around rising competition and the impact of AI on traditional IT services and software companies. Reacting to the sell-off, Tech Mahindra CEO and managing director Mohit Joshi termed the market response a clear overreaction. Referring to Anthropic’s announcement, Joshi said investors have become increasingly nervous about the perceived threat of AI to software-as-a-service (SaaS) and IT services firms.\n\"I certainly feel that it looks like a significant market overreaction. As you know, the market has been skittish about the impact that AI will have on SaaS companies. So earlier, the impact was only on the IT services or the consulting companies that had seen drops in valuation. Over the past couple of weeks, that contagion appears to have spread to the SaaS companies as well, with the fear that AI will replace SaaS companies and services. As we discussed, we feel that there is a significant amount of work that still needs to be done. At the end of the day, this is a technology shift. And every single technology shift in history has proven to be a tailwind for the services and for the software business,\" Joshi said.\nThe sell-off followed the release of an updated version of Anthropic’s chatbot Claude, which includes a new plug-in for legal services. The development unsettled global technology stocks, with Indian IT exporters tracking weakness on Wall Street, which had closed sharply lower a day earlier.\nJoshi pushed back against that view, arguing that productivity gains from AI vary widely depending on the nature of IT environments. “If you’re talking about a greenfield estate, where you’re building a new IT setup from scratch, productivity can be very high because it’s all new architecture and new languages,” he said. “But if you’re talking about a legacy estate, which is what 99 per cent of enterprises have, the productivity numbers are much more modest.”\nHe added that the scale of the market reaction appeared disproportionate to recent developments. “I do feel that this is a market overreaction to a very specific piece of news. It certainly appears to have been very widespread,” Joshi said. “We saw Accenture, IBM and Cognizant drop by around 10 per cent, but there was also a huge impact on Salesforce and ServiceNow. It feels like a massive overreaction to nothing that has materially changed over the past two weeks.”\nIn Indian markets, the sharp decline in IT stocks dragged the Nifty IT index down more than 7 per cent to an intraday low of 35,809.50 on Wednesday. The index later recovered some ground to close at 36,345.65. Heavyweights including Infosys, Tech Mahindra, LTI Mindtree and Tata Consultancy Services fell as much as 8 per cent during the session, reflecting the broader global rout in technology shares.\nGlobal equity markets remained under pressure this week after Anthropic unveiled a new suite of AI tools for corporate legal teams, intensifying fears of disruption across the legal and enterprise software industry. The announcement, made last week, triggered sharp sell-offs in European legal software firms, US technology stocks and Indian IT shares.\nAnthropic said the tools, embedded in its AI assistant Claude, are designed to automate routine legal work such as contract reviews, non-disclosure agreement checks, legal summaries and standard drafting. Delivered as plug-ins for in-house legal departments, the new Claude Cowork add-ons also extend into sales and marketing, finance and accounting, data analysis, productivity and search. Together, they turn Claude from a text-based chatbot into an AI agent capable of executing tasks across a user’s Mac files and browser.\nThe sell-off spread quickly across geographies. In the US, shares of legal and information services companies such as Thomson Reuters, LegalZoom and London Stock Exchange Group fell more than 12 per cent, with losses later widening across the broader software sector. Two S&P indices tracking software, financial data and exchange-related stocks together erased nearly $300 billion in market value.\nWeak global cues spilled into Asian markets. Indian IT exporters bore the brunt of the pressure, with the Nifty IT index sliding 6.3 per cent on Wednesday. Infosys was among the worst hit, plunging 7.3 per cent, while Tata Consultancy Services, HCLTech, Tech Mahindra and Wipro also posted sharp early losses. China’s CSI Software Services Index fell 3 per cent, Hong Kong-listed Kingdee International Software Group tumbled more than 13 per cent, and in Japan, Recruit Holdings and Nomura Research dropped 9 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.\nAmid the turmoil, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang sought to calm investor nerves, dismissing fears that artificial intelligence would make software companies obsolete. Calling the idea “illogical”, Huang said AI systems would continue to rely on existing software tools rather than rebuild them from scratch. “If you were a human or a robot, would you use tools or reinvent tools? The answer is to use tools,” he said, adding that recent AI breakthroughs are centred on effective tool use.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today.

The commission cited concerns of unfair business practices and potential abuse of market dominance, as the cancellations were said to significantly impact passenger access to air travel at a time of heightened demand.\nThe CCI’s decision comes as regulatory scrutiny intensifies on how airlines manage capacity and operational disruptions, particularly during peak travel periods, with potential repercussions for both travellers and industry competitors.\nAccording to data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), more than 10.46 lakh passengers across scheduled domestic airlines were affected by flight cancellations in December. Of these, IndiGo ’s cancellations accounted for the majority, impacting 9.82 lakh passengers. The airline spent Rs 22.74 crore on facilitation, reflecting the scale of disruption and the financial burden placed on airlines to compensate affected travellers.\nThe CCI’s 16-page order stated that IndiGo’s actions may have resulted in an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the Indian aviation sector. The commission noted that the cancellations withheld a significant portion of scheduled capacity from the market, thereby reducing consumer options and creating an environment of artificial scarcity during a period of high demand. The investigation will be led by the CCI’s Director General (DG), who is tasked with thoroughly examining the airline’s conduct.\n\"By cancelling thousands of flights constituting a significant portion of the scheduled capacity, IndiGo effectively withheld its service from the market, creating an artificial scarcity, limiting consumer access to air travel during peak demand,\" the order read.\nIndiGo currently holds over 65% of India’s domestic airline market, granting it a dominant position. In comparison, the Air India Group and Akasa Air held 29.6% and 5.2% of the market, respectively, in December, while SpiceJet and Alliance Air represented smaller shares. The commission’s focus on Section 4 of the Competition Act underscores the seriousness of the alleged abuse of dominance, particularly as the airline’s decisions affected such a large majority of travellers.\nThe DGCA responded to the widespread disruptions by imposing fines totalling Rs 22.20 crore on IndiGo for lapses in December. Additionally, the regulator instructed IndiGo to provide a bank guarantee of Rs 50 crore to ensure long-term systemic corrections. The DGCA also issued warnings to the airline’s CEO Pieter Elbers and two other senior executives, highlighting the regulatory emphasis on accountability and compliance within the sector.\nThe CCI order points to the potential for unfair limitation of services by dominant market players. \"Such conduct by a dominant enterprise may be viewed as restricting the provision of services under Section 4(2)(b)(i) of the Act,\" the regulator said. The investigation will assess whether these actions breached competition law and if corrective measures are warranted to protect consumer interests.\nFlight delays in December also contributed to substantial inconvenience, with 8.34 lakh passengers impacted. Airlines spent an additional Rs 4.50 crore towards facilitation for those affected by delays, illustrating the broader operational challenges facing the industry during the period in question. The outcome of the CCI's investigation may set important precedents for the regulation of airline conduct in India's aviation market.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

In comparison, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) sold 63,087 units last month, notching 22% year-over-year jump.\n“January saw a very good momentum. We were pleasantly surprised. VAHAN was very good at almost 65,000-plus. We have to see how things progress going forward,” Tarun Garg, the first Indian managing director and CEO of Hyundai Motor India, said in a media conference call after the company announced its third-quarter earnings.\nIn January, retail sales of India’s biggest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, rose 2.3% year-on-year to 2,15,934 vehicles—more than the combined volumes of Hyundai, M&M and Tata Motors.\nThis robust January sales come as the Indian auto industry benefitted from supportive policy measures announced by the government. The GST reforms and interest rate cuts significantly improved customers’ buying sentiment, said Garg.\nHyundai also recorded its highest-ever monthly domestic wholesales of 59,107 units in January, registering a 9.5% year-on-year growth.\nWhile every segment seems to be growing, data suggests that growth is higher in the compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) space compared to hatchbacks, Garg said.\n“After the GST rate cut, it is very clear that the trend is towards SUVs. From April 2025 to August 2025, the SUV contribution stood at 53.8%. From September 2025 to January 2026, it is 56.5%,” Garg explained, adding that this growth is aided by more models being launched in the SUV category.\nHyundai’s SUV contribution stood at 70% in the third quarter of FY26 while hatchbacks accounted for 17% share and sedans 13%.\nThe taxi market will help Hyundai get more volumes going ahead, said Garg. “The taxi market is over 300,000 vehicles annually. We believe there is a great opportunity there,” he added.\nOn the comeback of urban demand, Garg said, “Until about six months back, it was only rural which was driving the growth for the industry. However, now, while rural is driving, urban has also started chipping in.”\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today. India Today Group.",

        "full_content": "Vinay Tonse, former SBI MD\nA career State Bank of India (SBI) banker Vinay Tonse is all set to become the new MD, CEO of YES Bank. Tonse superannuated in November last year from his post as MD of the country’s largest bank, while YES Bank chief Prashant Kumar—who was ex SBI CFO himself--is demitting office in April. Apart from his proven banking experience, timing worked perfectly for Tonse’s appointment, who, according to his colleagues is among the hardest-working professional in the industry.\n“He is a mild-mannered banker, not aggressive in his behaviour. I have seen him working hard, with sincerity and he is very knowledgable having worked across credit, treasury and international business segments,” said an ex-colleague of Tonse.\nCareer trajectory\nTonse started his career with SBI in 1988 as a Probationary Officer. Working across different regions in India and globally, he managed business areas touted as most critical in India’s banking landscape, such as corporate credit, international banking, treasury operations, equity portfolio management, retail banking and agriculture and rural banking.\nHe led SBI Mutual Funds as MD, CEO between 2020-2022, the largest Asset Management Company in India. Before SBI MF, Tonse was heading the critical Chennai Circle of SBI as Chief General Manager, managing 15,000 employees and a network of 1,260 branches and offices of SBI situated in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.\nTonse also served as CEO, SBI Osaka Branch, Japan between 2009 to 2013, handled deputy MD position in-charge of corporate accounts group at SBI’s iconic corporate centre in Mumbai. In late 2023, Tonse was elevated to the position of MD, retail business and operations, handling on-ground operations across over 23,000 branches.\nThe incoming YES Bank boss is a B.Comm graduate from St. Joseph College of Commerce, Bangalore, and completed Master’s in Commerce from Bangalore University.\nTask cut-out\nTonse’s biggest test would be to improve the retail segment profitability at YES Bank. After a SBI-led consortium rescued YES Bank by infusing about Rs 10,000 crore in 2020, the lender under Kumar’s leadership took a conservative approach in growing YES Bank’s loan book. The management focused on first gaining confidence of worried depositors, addressing legacy asset quality challenges, and growing secured loan business--which provided comfort to asset quality--but makes lesser returns than unsecured higher yielding products.\nYES Bank’s net interest margin (NIM), a key indicator of profitability, standing at 2.6 per cent as on December end, is among the lowest among its peer set. SBI was the largest investor in YES Bank, but with Japanese lender SMBC picking up 24 per cent stake in YES, it is no longer the case and it will be the prerogative of Tonse to coordinate and work with the largest investors in the bank, who may gradually become promoters of the lender.\nBeing from SBI, Tonse is likely to continue with the conservatism that his predecessor brought to the table when it comes to lending. In order to grow NIMs, he may be open to expanding the unsecured lending, but only after having all the guardrails in place. Tonse has his tasks cut-out over the next three term.ENDS\nPublished on  February 4, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

Further, passengers were left to seek alternatives, on their own, at significantly higher prices,” CCI said in its order on Wednesday. It noted that given IndiGo’s dominant position, consumers were effectively locked in and lacked viable alternatives, which appears to be in violation of relevant provisions of law.\nCCI also noted that by the cancellation of thousands of flights that constitute a significant portion of the scheduled capacity, IndiGo effectively withheld its service from the market, creating an artificial scarcity, limiting consumer access to air travel during peak demand. It noted that such conduct by a dominant enterprise may be viewed as restricting the provisions of services under the Competition Law.\nThe CCI carried out a preliminary inquiry following a passenger complaint.\nIn response to CCI queries, IndiGo said issue raised in the complaint do not fall within the jurisdiction of the CCI and asked that no further action be taken in the matter. It further argued that under aviation law and rules  Directorate General of Civil Aviation had the exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate on issues raised in the complaint. It further contended that any residual individual consumer grievances relating to service outcomes, such as flight cancellations or consequential pricing concerns, are appropriately redressed under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and do not give rise to a cause of action under Competition Law.\nThe Commission observed that the disruptions of flights by IndiGo were not confined to one or a few routes but occurred almost simultaneously across a wide network of domestic origin–destination pairs. Cancellations and delays affected passengers flying between many different origins and destinations at the same time, creating a system-wide capacity shock. In such a situation, the harm is no longer confined to this route versus that route; rather, the conduct constrains the overall ability of consumers to use domestic air travel as a mode of transport, regardless of which specific pair of cities they want to fly between. The impact was felt across multiple routes and hubs, and passengers on different routes were all affected by a common constraint.  Hence, it is appropriate to treat the relevant product market as “market for domestic air passenger transport services” and to define the relevant geographic market as the whole of India. Hence, the relevant market appears to be “the market for domestic air passenger transport services in India”.\nPublished on  February 4, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

        "full_content": "Shares of Hindustan Zinc tumbled as much as 7% to their day’s low of Rs 594 on the BSE on Thursday after silver prices took a massive beating on the MCX, falling 9% or Rs 24,200/kilogram in the first hour of trading. In today’s session, MCX silver futures for March 5, 2026 plunged 9%, down Rs 24,200 to Rs 2,48,400 per kg. Volatility also rose after MCX imposed additional margins on gold and silver futures across all variants after a periodic risk review. Higher margins raise the capital required to hold positions, often leading to reduced leverage and some unwinding of trades in the near term. This can increase volatility and may put short-term pressure on prices. On the global stage, Hindustan Zinc ranks among the leading silver producers, with annual output of 22.5 million ounces — ahead of Grupo Mexico’s 12.1 million ounces and not far from top players such as Fresnillo at 52.5 million ounces and Newmont at 28 million ounces. The company also operates in the lowest quartile of the global zinc cost curve and has a mine life of about 25 years. Can investors buy? In a recent report, HSBC upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and raised its target price to Rs 750 per share. The brokerage values Hindustan Zinc at 11x FY27E EV/EBITDA, up from 9.5x earlier, placing it at the higher end of its five-year trading range of 5–11x. The valuation reflects the company’s strong balance sheet and a stable-to-improving outlook for LME zinc and silver prices. “We see further earnings upside potential from spot LME zinc and silver prices,” HSBC said. IIFL Capital, following the company’s Q3 earnings last month, initiated coverage on Hindustan Zinc with an Add rating and a target price of Rs 712. The management maintained its silver volume guidance for FY26 at 680 tonnes (±10 tonnes). While cost of production stood at $940 per tonne in 3Q, full-year cost guidance remains at $950–1,000 per tonne, reflecting higher mine development activity and grade volatility. Live Events For FY26, capex is guided at $700 million, split between $400 million for maintenance and $300 million for growth, with capex expected to rise further in FY27 and FY28 to support expansion.

The sharp decline mirrors a crash in the prices of silver, a key commodity for the Vedanta Group subsidiary.\nAt 9:49 am, Hindustan Zinc stock was trading 5.67 per cent lower at Rs 602.90 on the BSE, down from its previous close of Rs 639.15. The counter had been running upward over the last three sessions.\nTracking a plunge in the international market, silver prices on the MCX witnessed extreme volatility on Thursday.\nMCX Silver March futures opened gap-down at Rs 2.58 lakh per kg, lower than the previous close of Rs 2.68 lakh per kg. The white metal slipped as much as to a day’s low of Rs 2.44 lakh per kg, marking a sharp reversal from the surge seen on Wednesday.\nSilver prices are currently hovering in the Rs 2,50,000–Rs 2,60,000 range after retreating sharply from the peak near Rs 4,20,000. The sharp pullback has dragged silver below key moving averages, pointing to short-term bearish pressure and an ongoing correction, even as the longer-term trend remains positive, said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money.\nAccording to the company's investor presentation for the third quarter of FY26, Hindustan Zinc is India's only integrated and listed silver company.\nThe company earlier said that the precious metal segment is contributing significantly to profitability, accounting for 44 per cent of its profits, while base metals make up the remaining 56 per cent. In the third quarter alone, the company reported a silver production of 158 MT, which was up 10 per cent quarter-on-quarter.\nHighlighting silver's crucial role in achieving the net zero world, the company noted that demand is being driven by industrial applications, particularly in solar panels, electric vehicles, and electronics.\n“Strong buying interest is evident in the Rs 2,35,000–Rs 2,50,000 support band, aligned with prior swing lows and longer-term structural support.

        "full_content": "The company posted a 41 per cent rise in standalone profit after tax to ₹660 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2025, helped by operating efficiencies and higher profitability even as revenue momentum moderated.\nShares of Trent fell nearly 4 per cent in early trade after the Tata Group retailer reported its December-quarter numbers, prompting mixed reactions from brokerages that praised the margin performance but remained cautious on the outlook for growth.\nAt 10.21 am, it traded flat at ₹4,031.70 after falling to a low of ₹3,863 on the NSE against the previous close of ₹4,012.60.\nThe company posted a 41 per cent rise in standalone profit after tax to ₹660 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2025, helped by operating efficiencies and higher profitability even as revenue momentum moderated.\nBernstein maintained an outperform rating with a target price of ₹5,000, saying the quarter delivered strong margins while a growth revival was still “loading”. The brokerage noted that challenges on the growth front were already flagged in Trent’s business update and added that network expansion remained steady. It said the margin improvement trajectory appeared to have stabilised and was sustainable, though employee-cost leverage had largely played out and would now depend on a recovery in same-store sales growth.\nGoldman Sachs, which has a neutral rating and a target price of ₹4,530, said the EBIT beat was driven by higher gross margins but cautioned that most operating-cost benefits were likely behind the company. It flagged pressure on fourth-quarter profitability and added that negative like-for-like growth in the third quarter could weigh on Trent’s growth and margin assumptions for FY27 and FY28.\nUBS struck a more optimistic note, retaining its buy call and raising expectations of longer-term growth with a target price of ₹5,300. The brokerage said the quarter surprised positively on earnings, with strong margin expansion offsetting a weaker topline and negative same-store sales growth. UBS added that Trent continued to pursue its core growth strategy and estimated around 22 per cent revenue growth for FY27, with potential upside if demand conditions improve alongside ongoing operational improvements.\nJefferies kept a hold rating and cut a cautious tone despite acknowledging an earnings surprise driven by margins. With a target price of ₹4,575, the brokerage said third-quarter revenue growth was at a multi-quarter low, something it had anticipated from the company’s pre-quarter release. It added that negative fashion like-for-like growth was partly due to a shift in the festive calendar, a pattern seen across other retailers as well. While management continued to focus on expanding in both existing and new markets and improving disclosure standards, Jefferies said it preferred to stay on the sidelines until there was clearer evidence of a sustained recovery.\nNuvama maintained a hold rating and a target price of ₹4,543, highlighting year-on-year growth of 16 per cent in revenue, 28 per cent in EBITDA and 19 per cent in adjusted profit after tax. It said operating deleverage from negative like-for-likes was offset by better gross margins, possibly due to a favourable product mix and lower employee costs. However, management indicated that most automation benefits had already been realised, suggesting productivity-led margin gains could be harder to come by going forward, while rent growth remained broadly in line with revenue.\nCiti remained the most bearish among major brokerages, reiterating a sell rating and a target price of ₹4,350. The firm said revenue growth was broadly in line with its estimates, but EBITDA and adjusted profit after tax growth of 27 per cent and 40 per cent year-on-year were well ahead of expectations, raising questions about the quality of the beat. Citi pointed out that the EBITDA outperformance was led by a sharp expansion in gross margins, which it viewed as difficult to sustain because of a changing business mix, while the PAT boost was amplified by a surge in other income. It also warned that employee and rent costs had not fallen meaningfully in recent quarters despite rapid store area expansion, posing a risk to future margins.\nPublished on  February 5, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

        "full_content": "Shares of Hindustan Copper dropped 5.5% to an intraday low of Rs 579 apiece on the BSE on Thursday as global copper prices reversed sharply after logging their biggest single-day gain in more than three years on February 3. The pullback came as investors refocused on concerns around Chinese demand following heightened volatility in the industrial metal. Copper prices settled 3.2% lower, and recent swings reflect heightened uncertainty across base and precious metals this year, with investors rapidly unwinding bullish bets after sharp rallies. Although copper remains up roughly 5% so far this year, with prices touching a record above $14,500 a ton last week. Market pressure has been linked to signs of weakening spot demand in China, the world’s largest consumer, where higher prices have made the metal expensive for fabricators. Inventories in London Metal Exchange warehouses across Asia have also increased, adding to concerns of softening demand. At the same time, supplies are expected to rise as additional spot cargoes from Africa were redirected to China to take advantage of short-lived arbitrage opportunities, Bloomberg reported. Further weighing on sentiment, the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association has projected that refined copper output in the country could grow about 5% this year following a 10% surge in 2025. Local smelters — which produced 47% of the world’s refined metal last year — have been resilient despite a relentless expansion of capacity that’s triggered a collapse in processing fees. Prices had spiked on Tuesday after the state-backed industry group called for authorities to boost strategic reserves of the metal and for Chinese manufacturers to also build up commercial stockpiles.

Live Events Daily refined copper spot trading volumes in China stood at 28,900 tons on Tuesday, according to consultancy Mysteel Global. Although this was 24% lower than the three-month peak recorded a day earlier, activity levels remained relatively elevated compared with most sessions since November. On the corporate front, Glencore Plc has agreed to sell 40% stakes in two African copper operations to a US government-backed consortium, as Washington seeks greater influence over critical mineral supply chains. Orion CMC, a venture led by Orion Resource Partners with backing from the US International Development Finance Corp., has signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire interests in copper-cobalt mines located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Copper on the London Metal Exchange settled at $13,044.50 a ton, while most other major base metals, barring lead, ended the session in negative territory.

Devyani announced the promotion of Manish Dawar from CFO to CEO, effective April 2026. According to Jefferies, this move ensures leadership continuity while allowing the new CEO to reassess the business and steer the franchise toward sustainable growth. Chairman Yadav noted that Pizza Hut’s turnaround is underway and highlighted that January 2026 started positively across all brands except Pizza Hut . The company’s merger with Sapphire may introduce short-term uncertainty, but analysts view the move as a long-term positive for Devyani. Devyani International Q3 Performance Highlights: Devyani reported that consolidated and India revenues grew over 10% year-over-year (YoY), slightly below Jefferies’ expectations. Same-store sales growth (SSSG) showed mixed trends: KFC India improved sequentially but remained negative at -2.9%, while Pizza Hut India declined sharply by -9.1%.

Consolidated gross margin expanded by 20 basis points YoY, with EBITDA margins at 16%, above expectations. Brand Contribution (BC) margins contracted 40bps YoY to 13.9%. In India, BC margins fell over 80bps YoY to 13.1%, whereas international BC margins rose 50bps YoY to 17.1%.

In India, this included 54 new KFC stores, 18 Pizza Hut outlets, and 17 stores for its own brands—Vaango, BBK, and Goila.

Revenue grew 6% YoY, with dine-in share dropping to 55% (though up QoQ) and delivery rising 13% YoY. Gross margin increased 115bps YoY to 69.8%, driven by cost efficiencies and lower input taxes.

It also reported that The Times of India Group, whose digital arm, Times Internet, owns Cricbuzz and Willow TV, was evaluating both Royal Challengers Bengaluru as well as Rajasthan Royals.Incidentally, in early 2025, a consortium of tech head honchos including Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, and Times Internet VC Satyan Gajwani acquired a 49% stake in The Hundred‘s London Spirit for a staggering £295 million.Additionally, Bloomberg reported earlier that a consortium led by US entrepreneur Kal Somani was in the race for Rajasthan Royals. Interestingly, he is an existing investor in the IPL team. It was immediately unclear if Somani had also placed a non-binding bid for RCB. Private equity giants Blackstone and Carlyle were also named by Bloomberg and Mint as potential suitors for the Diageo owned franchise.Private equity firms have invested and exited IPL teams in the past.

The same suitors may evince interest in both Rajasthan Royals and RCB, the report highlighted.The report also indicated that depending on the strategy of the incoming buyer and the lead investor Manoj Badale, a 100% stake in Rajasthan Royals may be available if feasible to all stakeholders. Badale can also exercise the option of ceding control but holding onto a part stake and not making a complete exit from the team, it added.British-Indian entrepreneur Manoj Badale's Emerging Media Ventures holds around 65 per cent stake in Rajasthan Royals as per reports, with minority investors including American investment management firm RedBird Capital Partners  and Fox Corporation's Lachlan Murdoch, among others.Later on December 18, 2025, Moneycontrol was the first to report that a part stake sale was brewing at Kolkata Knight Riders.The KKR franchise is owned by Knight Riders Sports Private Ltd, which was set up in 2008 as a joint venture between Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment and actress Juhi Chawla and industrialist Jay Mehta-backed Mehta Group.According to reports, Red Chillies Entertainment owns a majority stake of 55% in the joint venture, Mehta Group owns the balance 45% stake, and the trio of Khan, Chawla and Mehta  paid around $75 million for the team in the inaugural IPL auction.\"Unlike RCB and RR, which are exploring a proposed majority stake sale, when it comes to KKR, only the Mehta group plans to offload a minority stake and unlock value. Investment bank Nomura has been mandated as an advisor,” the Moneycontrol report had said.Why is the IPL a lucrative opportunity?As per the \"IPL Valuation Study 2025\" by Houlihan Lokey, the IPL business value has risen to $18.5 billion from $15.4 billiojn in 2023. On the other hand, the IPL brand value rose to $3.9 billion from $3.2 billion in 2023.As per the study, RCB maintained the top position on the brand value chart , followed by Mumbai Indians , Chennai Super Kings  and Kolkata Knight Riders .The study also highlighted the difference between the IPL and global sports leagues like the NBA and EPL when it came to aspects like transfer fees and operating costs.\"From a dealmaker’s lens, IPL represents a near-perfect blend of predictable cash flows and cost discipline, a rarity in the global sports asset universe. Revenues are underwritten by BCCI’s long-term, well-negotiated media rights contracts and front-loaded sponsorship deals, creating annuity-like cash flows.The top franchisees clock ~₹6,500 million to ~₹7,000 million in annual revenues, with up to 80% visibility secured before the start of the tournament.

At 11.48 am, the stock was trading around 4 per cent lower at ₹4,028.\nThe weakness came after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to underweight, flagging growing downside risks despite HAL’s recent outperformance against the broader market. The brokerage noted that the defence major had beaten the Nifty by about 4 per cent year-to-date, while consensus valuation multiples had already contracted sharply over the past year. It warned that intensifying private sector competition and the possibility of slower execution, driven partly by high import dependence at a time when several countries are ramping up defence spending, could pressure the stock.\nMorgan Stanley cut its earnings estimates for FY27 and FY28 by 2 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, placing them below market expectations, and sharply reduced its weighted target price to ₹3,355 from ₹5,092. The brokerage also tweaked its valuation assumptions, including raising the cost of equity, lowering long-term income growth expectations to factor in execution risks, and trimming its terminal return on equity. At the revised target, HAL would trade at about 22 times FY28 earnings, prompting the downgrade from equal weight to underweight.\nHAL shares fall 8% on reports of AMCA project developments\nOn Wednesday, HAL issued a clarifications on operational developments. It said it had not received any official communication from the DRDO regarding reports linked to the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft programme and, therefore, could not comment on them.\nIn its latest stock exchange disclosure on deliveries of the LCA Mk1A fighter jets, the defence PSU said five aircraft were ready for delivery, while nine more were awaiting engines from GE. It added that five engines had already been received and that the overall supply position was improving. HAL reiterated that it remained confident of meeting its guidance for the current financial year, noting that design and development issues identified were being addressed in an expedited manner and that it was in active discussion with the Indian Air Force to ensure aircraft are delivered at the earliest.\nPublished on  February 5, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

In the same period last year, the company had posted a net profit of ₹ 115 crore. On a sequential basis as well, net profit improved by 16%.\nThis marked the third straight quarter of growth in net profit and the second-best quarterly net profit after the ₹ 435 crore reported in Q4FY25. However, the growth was largely led by a sharp rise in other income, which jumped to ₹ 241 crore in Q3 from ₹ 20 crore in the year-ago quarter.\nOn the operational front, EBITDA grew 61.2% year-on-year to ₹ 374 crore in Q3, while margins expanded sharply by 600 basis points to 18%. The company reported consolidated revenue of ₹ 2,129 crore during the quarter under review, up from ₹ 1,889 crore, marking a 12.7% YoY improvement.\nForce Motors, in recent months, has entered the list of the top 10 most-valued stocks on the Indian stock market, surpassing Hitachi Energy India, and is now the third-highest-priced stock in the auto sector, according to Trendlyne data.\nThe shares have maintained a consistent winning streak in recent years, emerging as one of the biggest wealth creators. Although the stock remained under prolonged stress along the way, it later showed remarkable growth, recouping all those losses and showcasing its ability to attract bulls at lower levels.\nThe stock has maintained a one-way run since February 2025 , closing nine of the following 11 months in the green, resulting in a bumper rally of 204%.\nZooming out, the stock has surged nearly 9,760% from its 2013 trading price of ₹ 225 to trade at the current price of ₹ 22,200 apiece.\nDuring this period, it delivered multibagger returns in five years, with 2025 marking the best performance with a rally of 216% , followed by 2015, 2014 and 2023, which saw gains of 188%, 187% and 161%, respectively.\nThe consistent demand for the shares on Dalal Street can be attributed to the company’s improving performance with each passing quarter, driven by steady growth in sales, which has supported higher valuation multiples.\nThe rally has not only boosted the company’s market capitalisation but has also multiplied the wealth of retail investors, who cumulatively owned a 26.1% stake in the company at the end of the December quarter, Trendlyne data showed.",

But for long-term investments, these are not the best of bets,” he added.\nBasumallick said that if an investor already has holdings in any of these stocks and has a very clear view on the underlying metal, they may choose to hold on or start selling slowly.\n“But I would always be very, very skeptical of buying, keeping investment positions in these kinds of companies,” he said.\nOn Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd ( HAL ), Basumallick said the defence PSU has been perennially underperforming and has been unable to deliver what has been ordered to it on time.

And ultimately, it is in the benefit of the country because they are in a very, very sensitive sector. We need aircrafts, we need helicopters, etc., that HAL produces. And they've actually been doing not a great job. So, personally, I think it's been, it should act as a wake-up call for them.”\nBasumallick said that if the company is able to get its act together, the opportunity size is very large. “There is going to be a short-term, medium-term hit because of this, because of the news,” he said.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

Given this deflationary impact that we are seeing, do you think getting back to double digit is going to be hard for the next three years?A: So, we said, while this is the guidance that we called out essentially as a bottom, our core thesis of growing in the low teens and several accelerators to get us to mid to high teens remains completely intact.If you look at our history, every year that we've grown under 10%, the next two years have been outstanding growth.",
        "full_content": "Hexaware Technologies expects business growth to improve after the first quarter of calendar year 2026, following weak performance in the October-December 2025 quarter. R Srikrishna, CEO and Executive Director of Hexaware Technologies said seasonal factors, client spending cuts, and furloughs impacted recent numbers.Srikrishna said the December quarter was below internal expectations but remained broadly in line with seasonal trends. He said, “Q4 was not very much what we expected. It is always a seasonally weak quarter for us. If you look at several years, we have sequential declines in Q4.”He said revenue declines in Q4 have been consistent over multiple years. The latest quarter also saw one-time impacts, including lower spending from a large client and higher furlough levels during the period.The company reported weak operational performance in the October–December 2025 period, with sequential revenue decline and margins coming below estimates.He believes some of the Q4 pressures will continue into the January-March 2026 quarter. However, he said the outlook improves after the first quarter. “Some of what happened in Q4 is going to carry forward into Q1, but after that period, we expect that we will grow nicely and accelerate growth through every quarter in calendar 2026.”Hexaware currently has a market capitalisation of ₹38,173.22 crore. The company’s shares have declined more than 18% over the past year.These are the edited excerpts of the interview.Q: Explain to us first what led to the decline in revenue in Q4, and second, you're saying that the company is going through an unusually weak period, seasonality aside, explain to us what it means for Q1.A: Q4 was not what we expected. It is always a seasonally weak quarter for us. If you look at several years, we have sequential declines in Q4. There were some additional one-offs. There was one large client that had a reduction in the quarter. There were higher furloughs than expected in the quarter, but in aggregate, it is still not very different from what we expected.Now, we said we are going through a difficult Q1 and Q4. Q4 I already spoke about. Some of what happened in Q4 will carry forward into Q1, but after that period, we expect to grow nicely and accelerate growth through every quarter in calendar 2026.Q: So Q1 also sees a decline in revenue?A: It will be. Historically, again, Q1 is always a soft quarter for us. It is flattish.Q: So Q1 could be flattish historically, and this time should be no different. But just coming back to the one-offs that impacted your revenue in Q4, could you put a number to it?A: So, there were two, and, I'll say between the two, it impacted 60 to 70 bps of growth.Also Read | Mahindra Lifespace lines up ₹8,000 crore launches to power FY27 pre-salesQ: Now, the big worry is these agentic artificial intelligence  developments from many of these big tech companies are going to put pressure not just on software companies, package implementation companies, but even the IT outsourcing companies which help with the implementation of this packaged software, the application development and maintenance, which is a fair amount of IT services revenues, ADM, as we call it, and that will cause revenue deflation. Explain to us how you see the impact and what exactly is happening.A: So, first is we agree that packaged software can get replaced by agentic workflows and by cloud-native software. We agree. However, we see it as a very large opportunity for us for two reasons.One, we don't have too much legacy business in packaged software implementation. So whatever headwinds are there, they are very limited for us on that front.More importantly, three weeks ago, we were the first in the world to launch a service called Zero Licence. Zero Licence, essentially, as the name suggests, is a proposition to help our customers get off any licensed software, which includes Commercial Off-the-Shelf , packaged software, and Software as a Service .So, we agree with the thesis that they can be replaced. But we actually think it's a very large opportunity for Hexaware. We were the first in the world to launch a service specific to that.Q: Using AI, is it fundamentally, in a way, deflationary? The question is about pricing at the end of the day. Because you're replacing something. The industry was earning $100. Effort goes down by 25–30% in some cases, so that 100 is not 100, maybe it is 90, 80, 70, or 50. So what's the rate of growth from here we're looking at? That's the real question.A: So, both of what you said are correct.First is that for any piece of work that goes through transformation, it often happens at the point of rebid. There will be deflation. We said in an earnings call earlier today that in traditional services, there will be a deflationary impact, and we've accounted for that in the numbers we're talking about.On the other hand, there will be new services and new volumes that more than make up for it. Let me give you two examples of services we've launched that have new volumes.First, a year ago, we launched a service called Legacy Modernisation. This is to help modernise code written 70 years ago that nobody in the world knows anything about.Now, this is a problem that could not be solved without AI, and now customers are putting big budgets to solve for legacy. That's example one.Example two is the one that we just spoke about — SaaS. Think of that market. It's in hundreds of billions of dollars. That's all net new wallet. Because the code is not going to write itself. It's not just about the code. You have to understand the business processes that are encoded. How do you understand those business processes? Then the last step is generating the code, which is easier, but in aggregate, it is still a lot of work and a lot of spending, which went into the licence fee that will get translated to custom software development and agentic development.Also Read | Pidilite sees strong push from renovation and construction chemicalsQ: What's the extent of deflation seen in the legacy traditional business?A: Whenever a customer is going through a process of saying, okay, now let's do it in a new way, and often it's at the point of renewal, it could be 20–40% depending on the type of work.But not all of this is happening on day one or at a given point in time. So, in aggregate, because these tend to get staggered over a fairly long period of time in a given year, we think it will be like 2–3% deflation, and we accounted for that in how we think about our numbers.Q: And will this 2–3% annual deflationary impact that you're seeing today accelerate? Can that become 5–6% in the coming year?A: I think that the new services and the new kind of work — it's not going to go to everyone — but people who are focused on it, are agile, nimble, and have innovation to address the new areas, that will far exceed the deflation. So, in aggregate, we expect there will be net positive growth because of AI.Q: You have guided for this calendar year's growth to be better than last year, which is 7-7.5%. But you're a company which used to see double-digit growth, mid-teens, high-teens kind of revenue growth. Given this deflationary impact that we are seeing, do you think getting back to double digit is going to be hard for the next three years?A: So, we said, while this is the guidance that we called out essentially as a bottom, our core thesis of growing in the low teens and several accelerators to get us to mid to high teens remains completely intact.If you look at our history, every year that we've grown under 10%, the next two years have been outstanding growth. So, I don't expect a challenge in getting to double-digit growth in the future at all.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

The platform follows a zero-commission and surge-free pricing system with profits distributed directly to drivers.Drivers on the platform, called “Sarathis,” are shareholders in the cooperative. Instead of per-ride commissions, drivers pay a flat daily fee to use the app. The model is designed to increase driver earnings and reduce passenger fares.During today’s event, the top six Sarathis will be honoured. Amit Shah will distribute share certificates to them under the “Sarathi Hi Malik” principle.Each will receive personal accident insurance of ₹5 lakh and family health insurance of ₹5 lakh. Nine MoUs will be signed with public and private stakeholders. More than 1,200 Sarathis are expected to attend.The ministry has described Bharat Taxi as the world’s first and largest cooperative-based ride-hailing platform and the largest driver-owned mobility platform. The service plans to expand to all states and cities within two years and set up dedicated support centres in every state.Fares are estimated to be up to 30% lower than those of private aggregators. Savings from the zero-commission structure are expected to be passed on to passengers. This may increase price competition in city cab markets where Ola, Uber, and Rapido operate.An official statement said the service began pilot operations on December 2, 2025, in Delhi-NCR and Gujarat. It added that over 3 lakh drivers and more than 1 lakh users have registered so far, with more than 10,000 rides being completed daily in the pilot regions.The statement said around ₹10 crore has been distributed directly to drivers to date. Drivers are allowed to operate on other platforms and are not bound by exclusivity clauses. Support centres are functioning at seven locations in Delhi.The platform includes safety features such as verified driver records, emergency assistance, and a dedicated helpline. Bharat Taxi offers social security measures for drivers. These include health insurance, accident insurance, retirement savings support, and a structured assistance system.A women-focused service called “Bike Didi” has onboarded more than 150 women drivers. The cooperative is backed by major institutions in the sector. These include IFFCO, Amul, NCDC, NABARD, NDDB, KRIBHCO, NAFED, and NCEL.",

With the integration phase nearing completion and non-core activities streamlined, the company expects double-digit margins in Core Diagnostics from next year, adding a fresh leg to earnings growth and improving overall operating leverage.Going forward, the company expects its TrueHealth preventive portfolio and specialty diagnostics to outpace overall growth. Rising awareness, improved affordability, and the ability to bundle diagnostic tests with consultations and wellness insights are helping Metropolis deepen customer engagement and improve realisations, supporting a steady expansion in these higher-margin segments.In October-December quarter , Metropolis Healthcare reported a revenue of ₹405.91 crore, profit of ₹41.39 crore and margins of 23%.Below are the edited excerpts of the conversation.Q: Your Truhealth and your specialty portfolio did record strong growth. Your Truhealth, which is preventive testing, which did well this quarter. In fact, it did see a growth of around 25% to ₹69 crores. And your specialty business, which is your core business, was up around 16% odd, which is around close to 40% of your total sales. What is leading and driving this growth? And is this kind of growth sustainable going forward?A: We had a very emphatic quarter, quarter three was one of the best performance we had in the recent past. The revenues were largely driven even by the Truhealth performance as well as the specialty. Now, what's happening on the Truhealth is, the overall awareness about the preventive health is increasing in the country.We have created a bigger market now, and the affordability is improving. And of course, your ability to bundle the products and create value for the customers in terms of getting their basic vital test done, ECG done, and do a doctor consultation along with a wellness report and all this is the value creation that we have done for the consumer. As a result, we are seeing continuous improvement in the Truhealth portfolio, now growing roughly about 25% for the organic business.On the specialty side, Metropolis always been a specialty company. All complex test you know, it's been done by Metropolis. We are improving our ability and capabilities, or doing more and more specialty tests, and the integration of Core Diagnostics have really helped us in creating a very high-end test capability on the oncology side. So all this is really helping us in terms of improving the overall realisation, and that's what we see in the quarter three results.Q: TruHealth and specialty diagnostics are currently driving growth and together account for about 40% of revenues, with growth of around 17%. How do you see the contribution of these segments evolving from here, and do you expect this share to increase further in FY27 and beyond?A: When the TruHealth and specialty is growing higher than the overall company level margin, these are the one which is really driving the growth. Hence their contribution will definitely keep improving as we go along. Our ability to convert a customer coming for a single test and then asking him or her to get a bundle test and some different test been done - that capability is also increasing. We clearly see that the TruHealth portfolio, as well as specialty will keep getting better as you go forward.Q: I understand that quarter three was impacted by some amount of seasonality. What are you expecting in quarter four when it comes to see organic growth?A: We have beaten the seasonality in quarter three. Quarter three, normally used to be a softer quarter, and if you seen the results of many other companies in diagnostic space, the quarter three has not been very strong. However, some proactive action that we have taken at the beginning of quarter three has helped us to beat the seasonality. We have delivered a very good performance and in quarter three.For us, the overall estimate for the year is always been about 12 to 13% revenue growth, and we are very sure about delivering the higher-end of that band that we talked about, 12 to 13%. It could be a little higher than 13% for the full year basis for the revenue growth.Q: What about your key acquisitions, how they performed during the quarter? Organic growth 15%, but Core Diagnostics, Scientific Pathology, Dr. Ahuja's Pathology - how has all these performed for the company? How is the growth there?A: Let me talk about the smaller ones first, which is the Scientific Pathology, Dr. Ahuja's Pathology in Dehradun all of them are growing equal or better than the company growth in terms of revenue and their margins are better than the company levels of margins.Core Diagnostics, we have said in the first year our focus is basically the bigger integration that we have done. Our focus is to get the integration completed and clean up all the businesses, which we really don't want to do, and focus more on, margin improvement in year one. So, that progress, as per our stated objectives, are getting better.As we are coming close to this year, we are definitely in a position to achieve our objectives we set out for the Core Diagnostics. The next year could be a year of accelerating revenues as well as bringing margins above a two-digit number.Q: Are you in a position to take price hikes based on what you are seeing in your competitive environment, and if so, to the tune of how much and by when?A: Every year, we do a price increase in the month of January, but we haven't done this year the price increase because of the GST considerations, etc. that we could get. Hence, we wanted to pass on the benefit to the consumer and we did not do a price increase this year.We believe that the market is conducive for price increase, and then can take a price hike, but we have not set any timelines for price increase, maybe at the appropriate time, we will look at the opportunity to take the price increase.Follow our live blog for more stock market updates",

However, rising inventories have tested demand for the red metal, which is widely used in construction and electrification.\nInventories in London Metal Exchange warehouses in Asia have also been rising, testing the rally of the red metal.

During the reporting quarter, the wind energy company achieved its highest-ever quarterly deliveries of 617 MW, up from 447 MW in Q3FY25, which boosted the consolidated revenue to ₹ 4,228 crore.\nIn the same period last year, the company had reported a revenue of ₹ 2,969 crore.

Of this, the S144 order book stood at 5.69 GW, making it the dominant product in the Indian market, as per the company's regulatory filing.\nJP Chalasani, Chief Executive Officer, Suzlon Group, said, “Our closing order book of 6.4 GW stands higher than the opening order book for the quarter, despite the highest-ever deliveries in 30 years. This reflects the demand for our solutions and the effectiveness of our execution. Our balanced EPC strategy—targeting around a 50% share of the EPC business by 2028—is progressing steadily, with the EPC share increasing from 20% to 27% this quarter.\n“Our project development pipeline of over 25 GW is also complementing this strategy to augur growth for us. The success of this shift is enhancing revenue visibility, improving project control, and will continue to be a key growth driver for the group,” Chalasani added.\nThe shares have remained under severe selling pressure since May 2025, closing lower in seven of the following eight months, losing a cumulative 33%. This has also led to a 44% drop from the September peak of ₹ 86.\nThe stock ended CY25 with a decline of 15.35%, marking its first annual fall in five years.

He said conversion of projects currently in advanced stages could help meet order targets.Welspun Enterprises reported consolidated net profit of ₹26.7 crore in the October-December 2025 quarter, down 65.6% year-on-year from ₹77.5 crore in the same period last year.The company has a market capitalisation of ₹6,394.72 crore. Its shares have declined more than 19% over the last one year.The company said it remains confident about future profitability and order pipeline, supported by project conversion and execution in the coming financial year.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: You had cut the guidance from ₹4,000 crore to about ₹3,600–3,700 crore. How confident are you about that? And if you could give us a sense of order activity — whether order wins this year could exceed your guidance.A: Yes, we had given guidance that we would achieve turnover of ₹4,000 crore at the consolidated level for FY26. Because of certain uncontrollable events like an extended monsoon, delays in the award of one of our major projects, and some statutory clearances, I don't think we will be able to hit the revenue guidance.But the positive side is that our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation  are very strong. Whatever guidance that we had given at the start of the year, we are likely to meet or exceed that EBITDA guidance on an annualised basis.I think the deferment of revenue from FY26 to FY27 is something which is like business, rather than anything which has to do with the fundamentals of the company. The company fundamentally remains strong, both in terms of profitability and on the order book.We had guided about ₹10,000 crore of orders we will book in this year, which, if we can convert in the next 50 days, which we are reasonably confident — that the Pune-Shirur scheduled project, where we have opened L1, will get converted into an order — we would have met the guidance, and we see a lot of traction going forward on orders.On an overall basis, I am very confident about the company's future and also about the profitability of the company.Q: So, with the Pune-Shirur project, you're saying execution will begin in this quarter itself, Q4? Is that the guidance, or will it spill into the next financial year? If you could give us a timeline, and therefore, what would the guidance for the full-year revenue be? What is the visibility you have right now, given that you've already cut your guidance for this year?A: The Pune-Shirur is a BOT project. If it gets awarded in the next 45 days, the revenue recognition for the project will start only after about five to six months.Also Read | Sugar prices must rise further to offset input costs, says Triveni EngineeringThe revenue recognition will be in the latter half of FY27, which is what we currently forecast.In terms of our guidance, will we be able to meet the revenue? Will the revenue for FY27 grow? The answer is yes. We are reasonably confident that the revenue of FY27 will grow, because a couple of orders that we are now booking will start contributing in the first half of FY27.Q: What kind of order inflow will you end this year with? You had earlier given a target of ₹10,000 crore, with the possibility of you outdoing that.A: We do believe that we will be able to meet ₹10,000 crore for sure at the consolidated level. We may be slightly able to exceed that as well, depending upon the timing of the awards.However, we are reasonably confident that we should be closing the order book for FY26 at an unexecuted order book of about ₹20,000 crore at a consolidated level.Q: On the Jal Jeevan Mission, regarding receivable stress, in the last quarter, you told us there was some kind of payment delay — about ₹200 to ₹220 crore of receivables was what you had flagged. Given the high exposure that you have to water projects and the sharp drop in revenue from the segment in the quarter, could you give us a sense of how the situation has panned out since then? Are you seeing an improvement here?A: Yes, we see some improvement there. The state has started releasing funds. We did receive some funds in the month of January, and the important point is that in the Union Budget 2026 speech, there has been an allocation to the Jal Jeevan Mission, which we believe will get released before March.So, we expect the receivables from UP JJM projects to get realised. And we see that in FY27, there is a substantial allocation towards JJM projects. So, we see continuity of support from the Centre as well as the state for these projects.Also Read | Hexaware CEO says slowdown temporary, growth to pick up after MarchSo, it is our belief that we will be in a position to recover our receivables shortly.Q: What is the number right now? How much have you received since then?A: We have received about ₹30 crore from the receivables. So outstanding would be somewhere in a similar range, because we have executed a similar amount of work. However, going forward, we expect that by March, this should drop by about ₹50 crore. Our receivables should drop by about ₹50 crore.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

        "full_content": "The report, titled ‘Transforming Indian healthcare, one specialty at a time’, said focused, single-speciality providers are emerging as the fastest-growing segment of India’s healthcare ecosystem.\nIndia’s single-speciality healthcare provider market is projected to nearly triple to $12.3 billion by 2030, from about $4.4 billion in 2025.\nThe market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 22 per cent, according to a new roadmap released by Bessemer Venture Partners on Thursday.\nThe report, titled ‘Transforming Indian healthcare, one specialty at a time’, said focused, single-speciality providers are emerging as the fastest-growing segment of India’s healthcare ecosystem. The segment is expanding at more than twice the pace of the broader provider market.\nBessemer noted that India’s $54-billion healthcare provider sector is undergoing a structural shift. While multi-speciality hospitals continue to play a critical role in complex care, a parallel ecosystem of specialised providers is scaling rapidly, driven by repeatable care protocols, concentrated clinical expertise and asset-light expansion models.\nThese platforms are purpose-built for scale, the report said, adding that speciality-native providers are increasingly preferred in high-volume, repeatable care segments such as eyecare, oncology and dental care.\nAccording to the roadmap, speciality-focused platforms are gaining ground due to superior patient experience, faster scalability and stronger unit economics. Learner, hub-and-spoke models allow standardised protocols and providers to expand quickly across tier-1 and tier-2 cities. Bessemer estimates payback periods of 12 to 18 months, with sustainable EBITDA margins of over 20 per cent.\nThe investment firm has backed this thesis through investments in companies such as NephroPlus, which operates dialysis centres across India and overseas markets including Nepal, the Philippines and Uzbekistan; Pluro, which focuses on IVF care; and Sukino, which provides continuum care services.\nThe report also highlighted a lack of nationally recognised brands across most speciality segments, creating a significant opportunity for founders to build category leaders. This, Bessemer said, can be achieved through a combination of operational rigour, superior patient outcomes and consolidation of regional clinic networks.\n“As this market races toward $12 billion, we expect the next generation of iconic Indian healthcare companies will be built one speciality at a time,” said Nithin Kaimal, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, India. The winners will be those platforms that combine deep clinical expertise with the ability to scale in a disciplined manner, expanding access and creating long-term value, he said.\nBessemer added that successful platforms could emerge as strong IPO candidates or acquisition targets for larger healthcare conglomerates over the coming years.\n(With inputs from businessline intern Tejaswini S)\nPublished on  February 5, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

        "full_content": "Data centre leaders also advocate zero customs duty on AI and cloud infrastructure, noting that attracting global companies could generate ₹40,000–60,000 crore in personal income tax annually\nThe data centres’ representative body, Bharath Digital Infrastructure Association, has sought the removal of the requirement for foreign companies to route their domestic revenue through an Indian reseller to avail of the tax exemption proposed in the General Budget.\nAmong the four conditions proposed for foreign companies to avail of cloud services-related tax exemption is the requirement that such companies provide services to Indian users through an Indian reseller entity. Arguing that this move does more harm than good to the ecosystem, BDIA said the government should allow direct service with competitive tax treatment.\n“The mandatory routing through an Indian reseller creates friction and additional tax incidence on Indian revenue. If the objective is to get these companies to set up operations in India, allow them to serve Indian customers directly from their Indian entity with clear, competitive tax treatment,” said Abhishek Bhatt, Secretary General, BDIA.\nCurrently, the condition requires companies to go through an Indian reseller, which taxes the reseller’s margins. However, this is an increase compared to the current offshore billing. Wrapping the tax holiday in conditions, notifications, deemed margins, and reseller requirements still discourages investment decisions, as per BDIA. In contrast, Ireland offers a single, simple proposition: a 15 per cent corporate tax rate, an extensive treaty network, and EU market access, while Singapore offers 5-17 per cent with clear incentive pathways.\nAside from reseller norms, Piyush Prakashchandra Somani, Promoter, Managing Director and Chairman, ESDS, pushed for zero customs duty on AI and cloud infrastructure and zero income tax on all international revenue.\n“Where does India makes money? Personal income tax from 50,000+ high-paid employees per major company is around ₹11,000-15,000 crore annually per company. If we attract 3-4 major companies that is ₹40,000-60,000 crore in personal income tax alone — far more than any corporate tax from deemed margins,” said Somani.\n“Whether domestic cloud providers like ESDS, Yotta, CtrlS, or others receive direct tax benefits from this provision is secondary. The primary national objective should be getting trillion-dollar global companies to make India their operational base for serving the world,” said the BDIA representative.\nMeanwhile, one of India’s major data centre players, Yotta Data Services, remained optimistic about the tax holiday, with foreign cloud operators leasing data centre facilities and GPU infrastructure from local sovereign data centre and compute providers to remain asset-light and participate in various sovereign opportunities that India presents.\nAccording to Sachin Tayal, Managing Director, Protiviti Member Firm for India, the tax holiday for cloud services can attract global cloud players to India while also sparking greater competition among sovereign and foreign players. The real opportunity for local players now lies in positioning themselves as trusted partners for sensitive workloads and national priorities.\nPublished on  February 5, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

The bank indicated that timelines will be guided by pricing comfort rather than quarter-specific targets.\nEdited excerpts:\nProfit growth has been strong again this quarter, with net profit up around 26%. What has driven this performance?\nThe profit growth has primarily been driven by robust credit growth of 13.59%. Operating profit has increased to Rs 9,119 crore, which provided sufficient buffer even after a significant 293 bps increase in provision coverage. Despite this elevated provisioning, among the highest in the industry, the bank delivered a strong net profit of Rs 5,155 crore, registering a YoY growth of 25.61%.\nWhile advances are up in double digits YoY, quarterly growth is just about 3.5%. Has the benefit of GST rationalisation flowed through?\nOur guidance was 10-11%, but we have exceeded that with 13.59% growth. On a QoQ basis, corporate advances grew 1.75%, which was a conscious decision due to pricing discipline. Year-on-year, corporate advances grew 6.95%.\nWe have been aggressive in the RAM segment, where spreads are higher. Our strategic objective is to move towards a 60:40 RAM-to-corporate mix, and we are progressing well in that direction.\nAs of December, the ratio was 57:43. It has now improved to 59:41, and our endeavour is to reach 60:40, possibly by the next quarter.\nHow do you see corporate lending growth going forward?\nWe have Rs 20,000 crore of corporate sanctions under discussion, which should translate into disbursements. While remaining conscious on pricing, we see good momentum on the corporate front as well.\nThere has been a sharp decline in current account deposits on a quarterly basis. What explains this?\nOne large account of Rs 26,000 crore was mobilised on September 8, which subsequently moved out. Excluding this, current account balances have grown from Rs 49,000 crore to Rs 54,000 crore, reflecting healthy growth.\nOn a YoY basis, current deposits are up 14.92%.\nCASA growth remains under pressure across the industry. How is Canara Bank positioned?\nCASA deposits have grown 9.32%, and the CASA ratio remains stable at 30%, despite industry-wide pressure.\nWe have rolled out several industry-unique savings products targeting different customer segments such as premium Payroll Account for salaried professionals, Canara Aspire for students, Canara Angel for women, Canara Crest for HNIs, and Canara Jeevandhara for pensioners.\nThese products offer differentiated benefits, helping us retain CASA share.\nPost GST rationalisation, which segments have seen strong credit demand?\nThe vehicle loan segment has grown 26.20% YoY, the highest among all segments.\nHousingloansgrew 17.58%, while overall retail advances rose 31.37% YoY, reflecting strong demand post-GST rationalisation.\nTraditionally, Q4 is one of the strongest quarters. Given the momentum built over the first three quarters, we expect similar or better performance in Q4.\nThere is a sharp rise in credit to petroleum, coal products and nuclear fuel. What explains this?\nThe increase is entirely due to exposure to PSU and Navratna companies. There is no exposure to private companies in this segment.\nTreasury income has risen sharply compared to peers. What drove this?\nWe booked gains from offloading stakes, 14.5% in Canara HSBC Life and 13% in Canara Robeco.\nAdditionally, treasury benefited from arbitrage opportunities post repo rate cuts, especially due to higher forward premiums, which were effectively capitalised.\nDid the bank benefit from OMO auctions?\nWe participated with bids of around Rs 6,300 crore, but gains were modest at about Rs 53 crore.\nAny plans to transfer accounts to NARCL in Q4?\nOne account has already been transferred this financial year. Two more legacy accounts have been identified, but bids are still under discussion. Final decisions will depend on valuation consensus among lenders.\nWhat progress has been made on M&A financing after regulatory easing?\nWe already have a dedicated internal project group at the head office. While traction has been limited so far, we are prepared to capitalise on opportunities, particularly through our four overseas branches for acquisitions of overseas subsidiaries.\nWe have 14 Large Corporate Branches (LCBs) with adequate technical expertise and remain disciplined on pricing.",

This, the brokerage said, had resulted in the stock trading at cheaper valuations compared with its average trading valuations over the past three years.\nUnder Bakhshi’s leadership, MOFSL said the private lender had undergone a radical transformation, shifting its emphasis from individual performance to team performance. This strategic shift had enabled the bank to consistently deliver stronger outcomes and move away from a culture that previously incentivised individual stardom, it said.\n“The bank’s strong focus on core PPoP growth while fostering a cohesive organisational culture underpins its position as a resilient and successful institution,” MOFSL said.\nMOFSL said ICICI Bank had entered a phase where its operating variables exhibited far less volatility and that the bank appeared well poised to sustain this leadership over the coming years.\n“The bank remains firmly on track to deliver RoA of 2.2 per cent in FY26E, despite one-off provisions in Q3, and RoE of 16 per cent over FY26-27. The bank’s approach is measured and deliberate, avoiding aggressive expansion while capturing market share in segments where risk-adjusted returns are favorable,” MOFSL said.\nWith the extension of Bakhshi’s term, the brokerage said the bank was well positioned to continue delivering best-in-class growth and profitability and remained one of the most dependable large-bank stories in the sector.\n\"NIMs have been largely stable in recent quarters, aided by a reduction in the cost of deposits, a steady loan mix, and disciplined pricing across retail and corporate books.

        "full_content": "A foreign traveller’s praise for the Kolkata Metro has struck a chord online, after a post describing a smooth, uncrowded journey went viral on social media and triggered a wider debate on the city’s public transport system.\nThe traveller shared their experience after using the Kolkata Metro, saying they were pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the ride was. In the post, they highlighted that the train was not overcrowded and described the system as “clean, modern, and good value.”\nI've been on the #Kolkata metro before, but was impressed with how it wasn't overcrowded, along with being clean, modern, and good value 👏🇮🇳🚇 #India #NonstopEurotrip pic.twitter.com/MAGKN9g8y9\n“I've been on the #Kolkata Metro before, but was impressed with how it wasn't overcrowded, along with being clean, modern, and good value,” the traveller wrote, tagging #India and #NonstopEurotrip.\nThe post quickly gained traction, drawing a mix of appreciation, scepticism and humour from users. Some questioned whether the experience reflected typical travel conditions.\n“Because you are riding in morning,” one user commented, suggesting the timing may have influenced the experience. The traveller pushed back, replying, “This was yesterday afternoon,” clarifying that it was not an early-morning ride.\nOthers reacted with sarcasm, pointing to what they see as a tendency to downplay positives about certain Indian cities online. “You cannot say or post positive things about Kolkata (or Chennai) in India. It’s prohibited by the Indian online community. Does not suit their narrative,” one user wrote, adding a laughing emoji.\nSeveral users also used the viral moment to underline Kolkata’s role as a transport hub in eastern India. “Kolkata is the only city in the eastern part of India which has an operational metro service. Do enjoy and next time bring your family,” one comment read.\nThe Kolkata Metro holds a unique place in India’s urban transport history. It is the country’s oldest rapid transit system, having begun operations in October 1984. Over the decades, the network has expanded steadily and now operates multiple lines covering more than 73 kilometres, with nearly 58 operational stations across the metropolitan region. Additional corridors are under construction, and future expansions are expected to take the total network length beyond 130 kilometres in the coming years.\nOne of the most significant recent milestones has been the full operationalisation of the East-West Metro corridor, connecting Salt Lake Sector V with Howrah Maidan, including an under-river tunnel beneath the Hooghly. The corridor has substantially improved east-west connectivity in the city.\nRidership numbers underline the metro’s importance, with the network carrying over 8 lakh passengers on peak days, particularly during festivals and high-traffic periods. While commuters acknowledge crowding during rush hours, many online agreed that the Kolkata Metro remains affordable, reliable and relatively well maintained—qualities that, they say, deserve far more recognition than the system often receives.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

        "published_time": "11:15:00 AM | 06 Feb 2026",
        "condensed_text": "Indian stocks, Desai argues in a strategy report, now offer an unusual mix of “inexpensive relative valuations, poor trailing performance, strong policy stimulus and a consequent growth upcycle, an undervalued currency, weak foreign positioning and potentially a new buyback cycle.” The 12-month trailing performance is “the worst in history” even as relative valuations are “approaching previous troughs”, with foreign portfolio investor (FPI) positioning having weakened steadily over the past four years. The report cites the combination of rate cuts, bank deregulation, liquidity infusion, continued capex, tax reductions and a “relatively stimulating budget” as evidence that “India’s hawkish macro set-up post-Covid is now unwinding.” Trade deals and a thaw in relations with China are seen as additional tailwinds to growth and risk appetite. Desai highlights that “the falling intensity of oil in GDP and rising share of exports in GDP, especially services, and fiscal consolidation imply a lower saving imbalance,” which in turn should allow “structurally lower real rates.” At the same time, lower inflation volatility, driven by supply-side reforms and flexible inflation targeting, should mean “volatility in interest rates and growth rates is likely falling in coming years.” Morgan Stanley’s base case sets a December 2026 Sensex target of 95,000, implying upside of 13% and a trailing P/E of 23.5 times, above the 25-year average of 22 times, to reflect “greater confidence in the medium-term growth cycle in India, India’s lower beta, a higher terminal growth rate and a predictable policy environment.” The base case rests on continued gains in macro stability through fiscal consolidation, increased private investment and a sustained positive gap between real growth and real rates, alongside “robust domestic growth, steady global growth and benign oil prices.” The bull case, with a 30% probability, pegs the Sensex at 107,000 by December 2026, assuming oil prices “persistently below US$60 per barrel”, successful reflation that lifts growth estimates, and a curtailment of the global trade war, with Sensex earnings compounding at 19% annually over FY25–28. The bear case, assigned a 20% probability, takes the Sensex down to 76,000 if oil spikes above US$90 per barrel, the RBI is forced to tighten, global growth slows materially and the US slips into recession, with earnings growth moderating to 15% and equity multiples de-rating to reflect a weaker macro environment. The firm’s proprietary leading earnings indicator “is suggesting improving earnings growth”, while its composite valuation indicator, which blends 11 absolute and relative metrics, points to “equity returns of around 16% in the next 12 months.” Sensex earnings in the base case are projected to compound at 17% annually through FY28, with the top-down framework for the broader market showing EPS growth of 22% in FY26, 20% in FY27 and 17% in FY28.",
        "full_content": "Indian equities are entering what Morgan Stanley’s Ridham Desai calls a “rare combination” phase that, in his view, strengthens the case for a valuation re-rating of domestic stocks. Indian stocks, Desai argues in a strategy report, now offer an unusual mix of “inexpensive relative valuations, poor trailing performance, strong policy stimulus and a consequent growth upcycle, an undervalued currency, weak foreign positioning and potentially a new buyback cycle.” The 12-month trailing performance is “the worst in history” even as relative valuations are “approaching previous troughs”, with foreign portfolio investor (FPI) positioning having weakened steadily over the past four years. “India could be a pain trade, which may just accelerate the returns on stocks,” the report notes, adding that an undervalued rupee and a friendlier tax regime are likely to trigger “more buybacks” and keep net equity supply modest. On the macro front, Morgan Stanley sees “a sharp turn in earnings growth over the coming months” as India’s growth cycle accelerates on the back of a coordinated reflation effort by the Reserve Bank of India and the government. The report cites the combination of rate cuts, bank deregulation, liquidity infusion, continued capex, tax reductions and a “relatively stimulating budget” as evidence that “India’s hawkish macro set-up post-Covid is now unwinding.” Trade deals and a thaw in relations with China are seen as additional tailwinds to growth and risk appetite. Live Events This macro backdrop feeds directly into the re-rating argument. Desai highlights that “the falling intensity of oil in GDP and rising share of exports in GDP, especially services, and fiscal consolidation imply a lower saving imbalance,” which in turn should allow “structurally lower real rates.” At the same time, lower inflation volatility, driven by supply-side reforms and flexible inflation targeting, should mean “volatility in interest rates and growth rates is likely falling in coming years.” Morgan Stanley’s base case sets a December 2026 Sensex target of 95,000, implying upside of 13% and a trailing P/E of 23.5 times, above the 25-year average of 22 times, to reflect “greater confidence in the medium-term growth cycle in India, India’s lower beta, a higher terminal growth rate and a predictable policy environment.” The base case rests on continued gains in macro stability through fiscal consolidation, increased private investment and a sustained positive gap between real growth and real rates, alongside “robust domestic growth, steady global growth and benign oil prices.” The bull case, with a 30% probability, pegs the Sensex at 107,000 by December 2026, assuming oil prices “persistently below US$60 per barrel”, successful reflation that lifts growth estimates, and a curtailment of the global trade war, with Sensex earnings compounding at 19% annually over FY25–28. Also Read | Gold and silver ETFs crash up to 10% for the second day. What should investors do? The bear case, assigned a 20% probability, takes the Sensex down to 76,000 if oil spikes above US$90 per barrel, the RBI is forced to tighten, global growth slows materially and the US slips into recession, with earnings growth moderating to 15% and equity multiples de-rating to reflect a weaker macro environment. Underlying the optimism is a call that the earnings cycle is turning. The firm’s proprietary leading earnings indicator “is suggesting improving earnings growth”, while its composite valuation indicator, which blends 11 absolute and relative metrics, points to “equity returns of around 16% in the next 12 months.” Sensex earnings in the base case are projected to compound at 17% annually through FY28, with the top-down framework for the broader market showing EPS growth of 22% in FY26, 20% in FY27 and 17% in FY28. Positioning and sentiment are the other key pillars of the re-rating thesis. India’s weight in global emerging market funds relative to its MSCI EM weight, and FPIs’ shareholding gap between the top 75 companies and the broader market, suggest “India could be the pain trade in 2026” if global investors are forced to add to underweight positions. Morgan Stanley’s proprietary sentiment indicator, which combines flows, volatility, trading activity and breadth, is firmly in the “buy zone”, indicating a contrarian opportunity. Meanwhile, the real effective exchange rate is near multi-year lows, historically a supportive backdrop for equities, even if the past relationship with stocks has weakened. The portfolio stance reflects a conviction that a macro trade is now unfolding. “Domestic cyclicals over defensives and external-facing sectors,” the report says, with an overweight stance on financials, consumer discretionary and industrials, and underweight calls on energy, materials, utilities and healthcare. Within sectors, the strategists argue that rising credit growth and low credit costs, a recovery in urban consumption and robust government as well as private capex make a strong case for domestic cyclicals to lead, while defensives and global cyclicals lag. Desai sums up the backdrop as one where Indian equities are backed by policy, earnings and positioning, but not yet fully priced for the improving structural story. With “high growth with low volatility” and a gradual shift in household balance sheets towards equities, Morgan Stanley sees the conditions in place for Indian stocks to “enjoy a rare combination” that, in its view, justifies a re-rating over the next couple of years.

Management has maintained that new business verticals and capacity additions are expected to support growth over the next few years.Kaynes has been investing in semiconductor and PCB manufacturing capabilities as part of its strategy to build a full-stack electronics manufacturing ecosystem. The company expects these investments to contribute to revenue growth over time, alongside its existing EMS business.The company reported its results for the October–December 2025 quarter on Wednesday, February 5, missing analyst expectations across key financial parameters.The company’s shares have declined more than 18% over the last year. Kaynes Technology currently has a market capitalisation of ₹22,792.12 crore.These are the edited excerpts of the interview.Q: The Street will be a little bit disappointed, because there was no hint of this sort of a howler coming in. So, clarify a couple of aspects. First, in Q3, was there some kind of one-off there? Was there some kind of revenue that hasn't been reflected that will get reflected in Q4? And also, what is the revised guidance for FY26, because it appears now that it's a very tall ask; you have only done 55% of what you promised.A: Fundamentally, the business, ironically, is poised at its best at this point. And, there are these quarterly numbers that are expected, despite a three-quarter growth of 37%, people do expect more, which I take as a positive sign, because I think it means that the public, the investors and customers, everybody is asking us to realise our potential.Fundamentally, this year, we will do about ₹1,700 crore in the fourth quarter, so that we can take up the quarterly number to about ₹4,100 crore. And this is without adding a particular product that we have developed for the railways, and a new version is being created for that. So that is a postponement for about ₹300 crore of business.Q: You said to do ₹4,100 crore for what period?A: For this FY26.Q: That is against what you said earlier?A: ₹4,400 crore was on a consolidated basis. This is primarily all the revenues have come in from the EMS sector. We are still tentative about the option chain  numbers being anything significant this year, so we will let it play out.Also Read | Kaynes Technology’s Japan partnerships mark next step in semiconductor strategy: CFOQ: What about margins? They're at 14.8. What happens here? They are about 100–150 basis points lower than what the street expected. What happens to margins?A: Margins will be around 16%. We did have a small expense out of the Labour Code change. Other than that, this year we will deliver about 16% on the EBITDA number, and the profit after tax  number will be two-digit. I don't think we will miss out on these two numbers, and for the quarter revenue number, it is about ₹1,700 crore, what we are planning. We have already completed one month and are quite confident that we'll deliver this number.Q: Is there any number on consolidated revenues for FY26 and also on working capital days, that have spiked up to 139 days? What led to that and what will it come down to by the end of Q4?A: I will answer the related question too, which will be the follow-up question. See, fundamentally, people are looking forward to us implementing all our capexes early and then making sure that we are operating cash positive. We came very close to being operating cash positive on a standalone basis in the parent company, that is, KPIL. We just had about ₹55 crore of negative cash flow at the operating level. But at the end of the year, the operating cash flows for the consolidated number will be significantly positive. That's point number one.And this is possible because we will most probably improve the inventory portion of our working capital, because the inventory has kind of gone up a little bit because of the delayed execution of certain orders and so on. We are taking stock of the entire situation and are hopeful that we will be able to deliver on the working capital number, which last year stood at about 85 days. So, this year, we are saying 70–85 days, somewhere in between there, and we have another two months to go. So, let's see where it lands.Q: Operating cash flows will be positive, right, when we reach the end of this fiscal year, correct?A: Absolutely.Also Read | 'I think market is making a mistake' — ICICI Pru AMC Co-CIO on why he avoids EMS companiesQ: What about the semiconductor facility that's expected?A: It will start this year. We have started commercial production. Our fiscal support agreement has been signed. It's important to know that, of the three clients that we have onboarded, we have already started working on the second client. We were the first to ship out the chipset. So, it takes a little bit of time. Sometimes, we probably overestimated our ability to get this done the first time, but still, it is the best in the industry as of now. Among all four peer group companies, we are the only ones to have exported India-assembled products.So, the primary plant, which is going to do the series production, is almost ready, and hopefully, we will have something on board. But I'm not able to commit numbers there yet, and that will be in addition to this ₹4,100 crore that we are talking about, which is our traditional - out of ₹4,400 crore, we had talked about ₹100 crore of revenues in the semiconductor area.I want to bring a very important distinction here. I know there are questions that people ask about other things, but our PCB facility has almost come up fully. With PCB investment, it was about ₹1,400 crore; and this ₹1,400 crore, we had not invested to just get ₹1,400 crore of the bare PCB business. We had also invested with an eye on the EMS, which subsequently can be done, because when we join early with the customers, about ₹15,000 crore of potential EMS is there, which is probably unnoticed by people. We have always been talking about us being an integrated company, an end-to-end company. So, going forward, $1 billion and $2 billion numbers, etc., will become more of a reality.Q: $1 billion by 2028, that's on, right?A: That's on.Q: A lot of sell-side analysts, all of last evening, were saying that maybe Kaynes Technologies had given some kind of hint that Q3 is going to be sort of a washout. But as you're telling us, Q4 is going to look much better, and you'll be ending at around ₹4,100 crore rather than the ₹4,400 crore that was expected earlier.A: We must look at two indicators. One indicator is what is known as a leading indicator, which is the order book. The second indicator is the trailing indicator, which is the actual performance on the street and so on. But, we weathered all of that, and we are still to deliver ₹4,100 crore without the support of any of the new businesses, which we most probably will do from the first quarter.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

For the three months ended on December 31, 2025, Suzlon Energy clocked a 14.8 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in the net profit at Rs 445.2 crore, while its revenue increased 42.4 per cent YoY to Rs 4,228.1 crore.

        "full_content": "Suzlon Energy target price : Domestic brokerage firms continue to remain largely positive on Suzlon Energy Ltd with select analysts expecting the stock to rise more than 55 per cent from its current levels. Other analysts, however, see some execution bottlenecks, resulting in trimmed target prices. Suzlon Energy’s consolidated revenue was below estimates as deliveries reached 617MW, 8 per cent lower than forecast, with Ebitda and adjusted net profit also coming lower than expectations, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Despite this, Motilal Oswal pointed to strong YoY Ebitda and delivery run rates for the first nine months, maintaining its earnings estimates. According to Motilal Oswal, key positives included management’s confidence in achieving FY26 guidance of 60 per cent growth across key indicators. Suzlon is on track to deliver 2.5GW in FY26, with 1.6GW already executed in nine months, a 66 per cent YoY increase. The order book reached 6.4GW by January 2026, with the EPC segment’s share rising to 27 per cent. \"Installation pace slowed, with 442MW installed in nine months due to right of way, land, and grid evacuation challenges,\" it said. Motilal Oswal expects a sharp pick-up in installations in the fourth quarter. The ebitda margin in the wind turbine business moderated to 13.7 per cent in Q3, compared to 15-16 per cent in earlier quarters. For the three months ended on December 31, 2025, Suzlon Energy clocked a 14.8 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in the net profit at Rs 445.2 crore, while its revenue increased 42.4 per cent YoY to Rs 4,228.1 crore. The company's ebitda increased 48 per cent YoY to Rs 730.5 crore, while ebitda margins improved 70 basis points YoY to 17.3 per cent for the reported period. Suzlon saw a strong growth in order inflow in the last two years, which led to its orderbook more than doubling to 6.4GW as of January 2026. In FY26 so far, its order inflows stood strong at 3GW aided by PSU and C&I orders. With strong order book and 4.5GW operational capacity, it has also been able to ramp up execution, delivering 1.6GW worth of wind turbines in 9 months, said ICICI Securities. In Q3, its volume stood at 617MW which led to revenue/EBITDA/PAT growth of 42 per cent/48 per cent/15 per cent YoY. Management had guided for 2.5GW of volume for FY26 and it has reiterated that guidance, implying strong volume in Q4, it said. Shares of Suzlon Energy rebounded nearly 2 per cent from days low at Rs 47.28 to Rs 48.19 on Friday. The stock is still down from its 52-week high at Rs 74.30, hit nine months ago. Suzlon Energy shares hit a 52-week low of Rs 44.84 on January 27, 2026 and it is down 10 per cent in the last one month. Motilal Oswal’s valuation applies a target P/E of 30 times to FY28 estimated EPS, setting a price target of Rs 74 (suggest 55 per cent upside), slightly above the historical average two-year forward P/E of 27 times. MOFSL cited a government task force to address land and connectivity bottlenecks, which could support Suzlon’s growth in domestic and international markets. \"We expect the order outlook for wind turbines to remain healthy for the next 2–3 years. Suzlon acknowledged wind project execution delays limiting its own execution potential and is targeting a higher share of EPC in its order book to get better control over project execution. It is also evaluating export opportunities,\" it added with a 'buy' and a target price of Rs 65 (Rs 76 earlier).\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today.

        "full_content": "International brokerage Jefferies has highlighted mounting pressures at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) reported a weak December quarter, with EBITDA plunging 91% YoY to about Rs 940 crore, though the performance was better than the brokerage’s estimates. Jefferies retained its Underperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 310, noting that improved India PV prospects are unlikely to fully offset the drag from JLR. The brokerage fine-tuned its FY27 and FY28 estimates, raising forecasts for India PV while cutting projections for JLR. While Q4 is expected to be better as production is likely to normalise in the March quarter as the cyberattack impact fades, Jefferies believes JLR continues to face several structural challenges that could weigh on profitability and growth. The cyberattack significantly disrupted operations in the second half of CY25, reducing production by roughly 50,000 units, or about 12% of FY25 volumes. Although volumes may recover in the near term, the brokerage sees persistent headwinds including rising competition, higher consumption tax in China, elevated customer acquisition and warranty costs, and the ongoing transition toward battery electric vehicles. In addition, key models such as Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender are now 3 to 5 years old. Jefferies noted that JLR’s break-even level has risen, with the business delivering an average EBITDA margin of just 3.6% in 9MFY26 on average quarterly volumes of 71,000 units, compared with over 9.6% margins in Q2 and Q3 FY22 at around 67,000 units per quarter. For FY26, JLR maintained its guidance of 0 to 2% EBIT margin and negative free cash flow of £2.2 billion to £2.5 billion. The company has deferred FY27 guidance to its June investor day, citing a business environment with more risks than opportunities. Live Events On the domestic front, Jefferies remains constructive on India’s passenger vehicle segment, supported by tailwinds such as a recent GST cut, improving liquidity conditions, and upcoming government wage hikes. The international brokerage, however, cautioned that it is unlikely to offset the JLR drag. Industry registration growth improved from 3% YoY during April to July to 15% YoY between August and January, and the brokerage expects an 8% industry CAGR over FY26 to FY28. Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle market share has recovered from 5% in FY16 to about 13 to 14% over FY23 to 9MFY26. The newly launched Sierra SUV has seen strong demand, with about 70,000 bookings on day one and a waiting period of 6 to 7 months, which should support growth. Jefferies expects Tata’s PV volumes to rise 18% YoY in FY26 and grow at an 11% CAGR over FY26 to FY28, with EBITDA margins improving toward 7.5 to 8.0% by FY27 to FY28. However, the brokerage remains cautious about the company achieving double-digit margins due to intense competition. It expects FY27 and FY28 to be better than FY26 but estimates FY28 EPS to remain 26% below FY25 levels, with FY27 and FY28 EPS still 23 to 33% below Street expectations. Tata Motors PV reported a consolidated loss of Rs 3,486 crore for the third quarter, compared with a profit of Rs 5,406 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue from operations declined 26% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 70,108 crore. The company said both revenue and profit were significantly impacted by the cyber incident at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), though it expects a strong recovery in the fourth quarter. TMPVL reported an EBIT loss of Rs 3,300 crore during the quarter. Domestic operations improved sequentially, supported by higher volumes and incentives. “Overall, it was a challenging quarter as anticipated on account of the carryover impact of Cyber Incident at JLR, while domestic business delivered robust revenue and margin improvement QoQ. We expect performance to significantly improve in Q4 with recovery at JLR and continuing growth in domestic market share,” said Dhiman Gupta, CFO, TMPVL. Tata Motors PV shares tumbled as much as 3.4% to their day’s low of Rs 361 per share on the BSE. (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "full_content": "Shares of cigarette makers, including ITC , Godfrey Phillips and VST Industries , surged up to 13% on Friday after reports indicated companies had raised prices following the recent tax hike, passing on higher costs to consumers. The rally was also supported by value buying at lower levels after a sharp correction triggered by the cigarette taxation overhaul announced on December 31, which came into effect from February. Godfrey Phillips shares rose as much as 13% to their day’s high of Rs 2,240 per share on the BSE. ITC, one of India’s largest FMCG majors, rose 6% to Rs 328 per share. VST Industries rose 6% to its day’s high of Rs 243 on the BSE. A report by CNBC TV-18 stated that higher-priced cigarette packets have been introduced in the market. Price hikes of between 15% to 30% have been taken across the board. For Godfrey Phillips, the 97mm pack is now priced at Rs 300 from Rs 240 earlier, a hike of 25%, according to the report. Under the new framework, excise duties on cigarettes were restructured to a range of Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 sticks, alongside a 40% GST. This has materially raised the overall tax burden on cigarettes, triggering concerns over demand, margins and the risk of increased illicit trade. Adding to the unease is a technical change in the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) announced in the Budget. Live Events The government raised the statutory NCCD rate on tobacco products from 25% to 60%, with effect from May 1, 2026. However, the Budget also clarified that the effective duty rate will continue at 25% through a notification, meaning there is no immediate increase in tax outgo for cigarette companies. In simple terms, this is not a tax hike today, but a future enabling provision. The government has created room to raise the duty later without changing the law again. In the December quarter, ITC reported 6.2% year-on-year revenue growth, driven by double-digit growth in FMCG-Others and steady momentum in cigarettes. Cigarette revenues grew 8%, supported by 7% volume growth. Margins in the cigarette segment, however, slipped to a multi-quarter low of 59.9%, contracting 163 basis points YoY due to the consumption of high-cost leaf inventory. Management has indicated that leaf procurement prices have moderated in the current crop cycle, which could support margins in the coming quarters. Axis Securities has said ITC's long-term growth trajectory remains intact, even though cigarette volumes could face pressure in the medium term due to higher taxes. It also highlighted continued progress in non-cigarette businesses such as FMCG, hotels and agri-business.

What is the situation that you are seeing on the ground currently and do you believe that, based on what you have witnessed so far does that improve in the fourth quarter, going into the final quarter of the year?A: If you see industry dynamics, the industry is not growing that high because Astral did a lot of decentralisation in the recent time and because of that, our volumes were excellent. We are expecting the volume will further inch up, because the industry was passing through a very tough time.Last three years, if you see the polymer prices were going down, and this is the first quarter where we are seeing that, at least now the bottom out is being taken place, and from here on, the prices have started going up. We are expecting better volume than what was there in Q3.Q: Do you think you will exceed your volume growth despite higher prices, and if you could break your Q4 targets, volume and value-wise?A: Normally, whenever the price rise is there, a lot of restocking take place in the street. Since you mentioned you are on fairly decent, low priced inventory right now, when do you expect the realisations to recover?A: Q4 onward you will see the realisation will start picking up.Q: From a medium- to long-term standpoint, what kind of revenue mix are you expecting coming in from the PVC plumbing business?",

What is the situation that you are seeing on the ground currently and do you believe that, based on what you have witnessed so far does that improve in the fourth quarter, going into the final quarter of the year?A: If you see industry dynamics, the industry is not growing that high because Astral did a lot of decentralisation in the recent time and because of that, our volumes were excellent.

That will help us in the further growth into the volume. We are expecting better volume than what was there in Q3.Q: Do you think you will exceed your volume growth despite higher prices, and if you could break your Q4 targets, volume and value-wise?A: Normally, whenever the price rise is there, a lot of restocking take place in the street. And secondly, there is a genuine uptick in the demand, which we are seeing from December onward. December was excellent number. January was good. February started on a very good note.So, because of that, it looks clearly that even if the higher price also, we will be able to surpass the volume what we have done in Q3.Q: I am sure you must be sitting on some low-price inventory as well. What kind of margins can you target in Q4 because of that? And going forward for FY27, what's your volume and value growth guidance, along with margins? A: Definitely we are sitting with a sizeable, low inventory cost. So, that is going to benefit us in Q4, as a result, margin should be a better in Q4. Historically, if you see, Q4 in our industry is the peak, we are generating the maximum volume. So, economy of scale advantage will always be there in Q4 and now with this price rise, it is double advantage to us.Definitely, Q4 will be much better. Once we will close this year, based on that, we will give our guidance.Q: What about top line, you had mentioned double digits for this year. You are at 8% right now for the first nine months. Do you cross them? A: It looks like that, we will be closer to that.Q: What about your adhesives and paints business? Paint industry, the biggies, have reported their numbers, and it's not particularly good, impacted by extended monsoons and, a shorter festive window as well. But you have managed to grow over 20%, what led to that? What's your plan here -- are you making margins, profit, have you broken even here?A: Right now, we are in a growth phase; we are opening in the whole new state, and from there, we are trying to catch the volume. In this quarter, we have grown by 21%. So going forward, we are targeting that may be one more year EBITDA may not be that lucrative, may be a lower-single digit kind of level next year.But the topline growth will be very high, as we are at a very nascent stage of the business and our base is low. So, on that low base growing higher percentage will not be a big challenge and then economy of scale will start playing. That will help us to generate the EBITDA positively.Q: Does the same apply to realisations as well? Since you mentioned you are on fairly decent, low priced inventory right now, when do you expect the realisations to recover?A: Q4 onward you will see the realisation will start picking up.Q: From a medium- to long-term standpoint, what kind of revenue mix are you expecting coming in from the PVC plumbing business? How much of that comes in from paints, adhesives and even your bathware division, which has done well just about broken even. What's the contribution target from these places? A: From here on, we are expecting that other businesses will keep generating between 33-35% kind of ratio and the plumbing will generate 67-68% kind of contribution. Bathware is doing very well. You can see in the last quarter's number also; we have grown by 36% which is a very encouraging number for us. The way we are seeing is that the acceptance is increasing in the project level going forward. We are going to even grow in much better way, as initial journey is always tough because it's the trial in the market.One day, will test our product. Then, we can start getting the bigger ticket size. Initially, they will give me one or two towers, but afterward once they test our product they can definitely give us the full projects also. Hence, revenue jump will be very high maybe one year down the length from here, but right now, still at this growth, we are at a testing level.Follow our live blog for more stock market updatesFollow our live blog for more updates on Q3 results",

We have been seeing that a lot of the auto component players like us have been exporting to the EU and the US. And now, with this stability in terms of tariffs and clarity, and also tariffs going down, definitely, it will open up a lot of opportunities. For example, we have also been in discussions with some of our customers. But because of some of these situations, things have not been progressing as one would have expected. Now that we have the clarity, things will speed up, and it will definitely open up a lot of opportunities for exports of auto and auto components.Also Read: Bajaj Auto sees export run-rate holding above 2 lakh units a monthQ: When we look at the auto sales numbers, it looks like the entry-level cars have done better, and that impacts the value proposition for you — yours is a premiumisation play. What should we expect in terms of volume and value growth going forward?A: In terms of vehicles being sold and with the current goods and services tax , it was expected that it would trigger more entry-level two-wheelers and four-wheelers sales. And that's what the data has been suggesting, because their kit value, obviously, is lesser in an entry-level car versus a premium car or a premium bike.Having said that, there has been a change in terms of the adoption of a lot of these premium features. So as the cost goes down, as the volume increases, even these premium features — which, say, for example, used to be in entry-segment cars or 350cc bikes or 250cc bikes — have been coming down to D-segment and C-segment vehicles, etc. So, the adoption has been increasing. For example, airbags used to have very low penetration. Now, it has been consistently increasing. The same thing goes for alloy wheels and some of the lights.As we move forward, we do expect this premiumisation play even to get into some of these entry-level segments — maybe not in the base models, but definitely in terms of the upper models of those same segments. Moving forward, we do expect this momentum to continue.Also Read: US duty relief could trigger fresh orders for Indian industrial and auto suppliersWe have been significantly expanding in terms of our product profile and in building our capacities in line with our customers. We are pretty confident that this growth momentum will continue. We are not going to give actual growth numbers because we do not normally talk about the OE one, but definitely our endeavour has consistently been, on an annual basis, whatever the industry grows, we consistently grow at least 1.5 times or more, and we are pretty confident that we should be able to deliver that.Q: How do you see the business evolving from here on? If you tell us the content per vehicle that you're dealing with currently — both two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers — and how you see that number scale up? Give us a broader time horizon, say, in the next 12 months, as well as 24 months. How do you see this improving, because you have been hinting about this in the past?A: There are some products which are currently in the development phase and which will get into the production phase sometime in the next calendar year. For example, sunroofs will get into production next year. Some of the EV-play components for four-wheelers will get into production next year. Some of the two-wheeler components will get into production next fiscal year.There are a lot of these products which will get into SOP at the end of 2026 and early 2027, so this consistently will help us improve our offering per vehicle, which will actually translate into the actual realisable. On top of it, some of the existing products are also seeing some switches getting into habit-based switches, or horns getting into electromechanical horns. Electrification for lamps has been a consistent journey for the last few years, and we have been seeing that sensor adoption is increasing. So, we are very optimistic.Watch the interview in the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

We are very optimistic about the future with the announcement of the Free Trade Agreement signed with the EU, along with the trade deal made with the USA. When all these agreements get ratified, it will lead to a big boost in global trade for India.Also Read: Gateway Distriparks aims to quadruple domestic cargo volumes in 2 years via Ankleshwar dealAdditionally, we started our domestic rail services from MMLP New Ankleshwar in October 2025 and are seeing continued traction. With the above developments, we are expanding our rail capacity by purchasing 3 new high-capacity rakes as well as swapping 3 of our older rakes on lease for 3 higher-capacity rakes. With this, by the end of Q1 next year, we will have 37 rakes.\"Shares of Gateway Distriparks Ltd ended at ₹61.18, up by ₹1.06, or 1.76%, on the BSE.",

The (thermal) power plants will now act more as balancing power plants and therefore the focus will be on keeping the plant uptime as high as possible, rather than actually trying to maximise the PLF,” said Dilip Jha, Chief Financial Officer of Adani Power.\nJha said the upcoming capacities will be built using advanced technology to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.\nThe power plants that we are setting up… will use a lesser amount of coal to generate higher amounts of power — up to 5–10 percent of advantage when compared to older technology,” he recently told investors adding that most projects are located close to coal sources, helping lower logistics costs.\nThe company currently operates 18.5 GW of capacity, of which around 90 percent is tied up under long- and medium-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with state distribution companies (DISCOMs).\n“For the new capacities that we are planning to set up we intend to tie up for long term PPAs, so going forward we are reducing our merchant exposure,” Jha said.\nAdani Power is executing a 23.7-GW thermal expansion programme, with multiple brownfield projects progressing across central and eastern India. Mahan Phase-2 is around 80 per cent complete, Raipur Phase-2 about 44 per cent, Raigarh Phase-2 close to 38 pe rcent, while construction at Korba Phase-2 has resumed, the company said.\nThese projects are scheduled to be commissioned in phases starting FY27. “Broadly speaking, around 2.9 GW will be commissioned next year.

While Adani Power shares have gained 13% post Q3 earnings, Tata Power shares are largely unchanged since February 4 (earnings date). In terms of stock price movement, Adani Power shares are in an uptrend, rising 65% from the 52-week low of Rs 93.23 reached on February 25, 2025. The Adani Group stock also trades higher than all the short-term and long-term moving averages.\nIn terms of financials, Adani Power has clocked delivered strong profit CAGR of 65.7% and a revenue CAGR of 93.9% over the last 5 years.\nOn the other hand, Tata Power shares have not clocked positive returns since two years except for a 5.31% return in two weeks.\nThe Tata Group stock trades lower than the 30 day, 50 day, 100 day, 150 day and 200 day but higher than the 5 day, 10 day and 20 day simple moving averages.\nIn terms of financials, Tata Power has clocked delivered strong profit CAGR of 84% and a revenue CAGR of 24.5% over the last five years.\nIn the current session, shares of Adani Power were tradign on a flat note at Rs 152.75. Market cap of the firm stood at Rs 2.94 lakh crore. Total 8.92 lakh shares of the firm changed hands amounting to a turnover of Rs 13.58 crore.\nTata Power stock rose 0.15% to Rs 364.85 today against the previous close of Rs 364.30 on BSE. Market cap of the firm rose to Rs 1.16 lakh crore. Total 1.13 lakh shares of the firm changed hands amounting to a turnover of Rs 4.08 crore\nJM Financial has a price target of Rs 177 on the Adani Group stock.\n\"With key enablers in place (land, EC, PPAs, and equipment) and management’s assurance of timely commissioning of projects, we expect operational capacity to reach 39.5 GW by FY32 and EBITDA/MW to increase from Rs 1.3 crore /MW in FY25 to Rs 1.8 crore/MW by FY32. We maintain a BUY rating on the stock with TP of Rs 177 per share, valuing the company at 13x FY28 EV/EBITDA,\" said Adani Power.\nMorgan Stanley has maintained its overweight stance with a target price of Rs 185 on the Adani Group stock. Operational performance was largely in line, said the global brokerage mentioning that adjusted PAT beat was due to lower interest and tax.\nThe Adani Group firm has received 3,200MW LoAs and has large capacity additions plans over F26-29.\nICICI Securities has a price target of Rs 187 on the stock.\nThe domestic brokerage said Adani has resolved its disputes, reduced the leverage and improved the profits of its operating assets. It is using its balance sheet to acquire assets at attractive prices. It is also setting up new assets to meet renewed demand for coal. It is ahead of competition in new build.\n\"As a result, it is able to tie up its existing assets under new long-term arrangements at attractive tariffs. Given the lower growth in power demand across the country in 9MFY26, resulting in lower realisation in merchant sale, which formed 20% of its power sales and lower PLFs, we revise our FY26E earnings. Our long-term outlook remains intact. We maintain BUY, with an unchanged target price of Rs 187,\" said the brokerage.\nHowever, the assumptions face likely challenges such as delays in construction of assets; merchant price risk; fuel risk; and counterparty risks.\nNuvama has a Hold call on Tata Power with a target price of Rs 388 (earlier Rs 385).\nThe brokerage said profit after tax was affected due to Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd losses amid plant shutdown awaiting SPPA resolution. Profit after tax was adjusted for one-off regulatory gains of Rs 340 crore in Delhi discom.\nNuvama said standalone PAT was negative due to Mundra plant shutdown.\nHowever, the performance of Odisha discoms improved sharply with profits up 2.6 times YoY on better billing efficiency. According to Nuvama, solar module manufacturing profitability may dip in Q4FY26 as captive consumption rises.\nThe brokerage said the management continues to target Rs 10,000 crore profit by FY30E as RE and PSP projects scale up. However, losses at CGPL are expected to continue.\nBrokerage Elara said Tata Power stands to benefit from power transmission capex, power distribution reforms and green investments. The brokerage aims to raise its RE capacity  to 20GW by FY30 and has capex plans of Rs 1.25 lakh crore for FY26-30. The firm is implementing 2.8GW of PSP projects and has a sizeable opportunity in solar EPC.\n\"We maintain BUY with an unchanged SoTP-target price of Rs 504. We have retained our earnings estimate,\" said Elara.\nJM Financial has a buy call on the Tata Power stock with a price target of Rs 429 against the earlier Rs 475.\n\"We estimate the company to report FY25-28 CAGR of 7%/11%/14% in Revenue/ EBITDA/ PAT. We maintain BUY, with an SOTP-based revised target price of Rs 429 (a 15% upside) implying 12.6 times EV/EBITDA and 2.8x P/B on FY28,\" said JM Financial.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

        "condensed_text": "The company is preparing an active launch pipeline across NCR, Mumbai, Pune and southern markets, backed by a large ready inventory base.Pandey said the company’s strategy going forward will continue to focus on steady launch execution, disciplined capital deployment and sustaining booking momentum, with management confident that consistent operating performance will support growth despite near-term market volatility.Godrej Properties reported a 20% year-on-year rise in net profit to ₹195.2 crore in the October-December quarter of 2025 , compared with ₹162.6 crore a year ago. From launches and sustenance, generally, for the last few quarters, a rule of thumb has been between one-third of our volume to maybe sometimes half of the sales is sustenance, and it's largely emanating because we have a very different structure in Godrej Properties, where we have a dedicated sustenance sales engine, which delivers consistent sales performance, whereas, when we get launches, the launch percentage tends to become slightly better.Q: In that case, how does the launch pipeline look, and how will you fund the upcoming launches?A: Because of the fantastic effort by our business development team, over the last three odd years, we have added about ₹1 lakh crore-plus inventory from 2022-23 . So, a lot of action is packed up, some of which we will see action in this quarter itself, and some of which we will see action continue next financial year, 2026-27 .I'll maybe mention some of the top-of-mind names that come to my mind, which are in this quarter, and their phase activation will continue next year as well, and some launches that can happen next year as well.Also Read: Raymond Realty sees stronger FY26 on back of premium and ultra-luxury launchesSo maybe a bit of a gist — in the north, we will see something very exciting in this quarter itself, which is a project by the name Godrej Arden. We bought recently in Hosur Road last quarter, a 30-acre parcel in a micro market, and this is like a ₹3,500 crore potential booking value that should hit the market next financial year.And then we bought something in Hyderabad recently in an auction, a prime piece of land of five acres, with a potential booking value of ₹4,500 crore, which should hit the market next financial year.In Mumbai, we have a series of launches. So, any developer who was looking at that as the core demand bucket would, of course, see some amount of hit, because that is an easy-come-easy-go market, I would say.But anything which is more end-user driven, which is in the right micro markets of Gurugram, is doing pretty well for us and for our competition and peer group as well.",
        "full_content": "Godrej Properties expects demand in its key micro-markets to remain resilient and largely end-user driven, even as speculative activity cools in parts of NCR, said Gaurav Pandey, MD and CEO of Godrej Properties. The company is preparing an active launch pipeline across NCR, Mumbai, Pune and southern markets, backed by a large ready inventory base.Pandey said the company’s strategy going forward will continue to focus on steady launch execution, disciplined capital deployment and sustaining booking momentum, with management confident that consistent operating performance will support growth despite near-term market volatility.Godrej Properties reported a 20% year-on-year rise in net profit to ₹195.2 crore in the October-December quarter of 2025 , compared with ₹162.6 crore a year ago. However, revenue fell sharply by 48.6% to ₹498.4 crore from ₹969 crore in the same quarter last year, and the company reported an EBITDA loss of ₹182.7 crore, against an EBITDA profit of ₹27.7 crore in the year-ago period.Operationally, performance remained strong. Bookings rose 55% to ₹8,421 crore, and collections increased 40% to ₹4,282 crore, while operating cash flows jumped 73% to ₹1,062 crore in the quarter. For the first nine months of FY26, bookings grew 25% to ₹24,008 crore and collections rose 19% to ₹12,018 crore, although operating cash flow declined 7% to ₹3,199 crore. The Mumbai-based company has a market capitalisation of about ₹51,259.30 crore, and its shares are down nearly 25% over the past year.Below are the edited excerpts from the interview.Q: Strong bookings in the October-December quarter of 2025  and nine months, will this trend sustain? What was the contribution from sustenance and sales this time?A: We had quite a stellar performance across markets, whether it is in South India. For that matter, we have had very good performance across projects and also. We had a lot of projects, a mix of both launches and sustenance, and also in markets like Pune and the likes of it. From launches and sustenance, generally, for the last few quarters, a rule of thumb has been between one-third of our volume to maybe sometimes half of the sales is sustenance, and it's largely emanating because we have a very different structure in Godrej Properties, where we have a dedicated sustenance sales engine, which delivers consistent sales performance, whereas, when we get launches, the launch percentage tends to become slightly better.Q: In that case, how does the launch pipeline look, and how will you fund the upcoming launches?A: Because of the fantastic effort by our business development team, over the last three odd years, we have added about ₹1 lakh crore-plus inventory from 2022-23 . So, we have something like ₹1,35,000 crore worth of inventory available. So, a lot of action is packed up, some of which we will see action in this quarter itself, and some of which we will see action continue next financial year, 2026-27 .I'll maybe mention some of the top-of-mind names that come to my mind, which are in this quarter, and their phase activation will continue next year as well, and some launches that can happen next year as well.Also Read: Raymond Realty sees stronger FY26 on back of premium and ultra-luxury launchesSo maybe a bit of a gist — in the north, we will see something very exciting in this quarter itself, which is a project by the name Godrej Arden. It's in a Sigma sector of the Greater Noida market. Then we have a residential pocket in Godrej Golf Links, a new opening that will open up. It should hit within this quarter. It could also move to next quarter, January-March 2026 , but there is a high probability within this quarter as well.Then we have a very exciting launch in Gurugram, a seven-and-a-half-acre fresh parcel in the Golf Course Road market. It's probably the best parcel in the Golf Course Road market that will open up very soon.Then, in markets like the South, we bought a series of acquisitions, some older and some new. So, we'll have something in Bannerghatta coming up very soon. We will have quite a few launches in Whitefield — such a good micro market. We bought recently in Hosur Road last quarter, a 30-acre parcel in a micro market, and this is like a ₹3,500 crore potential booking value that should hit the market next financial year.And then we bought something in Hyderabad recently in an auction, a prime piece of land of five acres, with a potential booking value of ₹4,500 crore, which should hit the market next financial year.In Mumbai, we have a series of launches. Worli will continue with a massive top line of ₹10,000 crore of potential revenue in the next few years. We have just scratched the surface from a potential point of view. So, I think we will see a lot of launches and activation in that particular project itself, of course, with higher price mark-ups as we continue to launch more projects. We have a lot of inventory left in periphery micro markets in Panvel. We launched some clusters in Panvel. Next financial year, we're targeting the launch of the first commercial sale product in Mumbai, in a Panvel micro market.And then we have some activations left in projects like Reserve in Pune. We've recently bought a very exciting piece of land, with potential, top-level roads — it's an eight-and-a-half-acre land parcel, Mahalunge. So yes, that has been one of our favourite markets. We are the number one player in Pune. And then again, there are quite a few launches in different micro markets of Pune and Ahmedabad.Q: You interestingly spoke about launches, especially in the NCR market as well. We have been seeing some slowdown, right? Stocks have been falling. We've seen the real estate index come off the highs as well. Are we beginning to see some slowdown here?A: There are two very interesting points you have brought up. One is the stock price, and then the market sentiment in NCR. I will take both of them.From a perspective on the NCR market, there was a crazy amount of euphoria that started post Covid. The speculative demand is what was making a lot of talk of the town. So, any developer who was looking at that as the core demand bucket would, of course, see some amount of hit, because that is an easy-come-easy-go market, I would say.But anything which is more end-user driven, which is in the right micro markets of Gurugram, is doing pretty well for us and for our competition and peer group as well. Noida, you will be surprised from a percentage growth point of view. Last year, if memory serves me right, was the highest growth market in India from a percentage growth point of view. It has done exceedingly well for a solid group of peers because the land itself is heavily regulated, since the government supplies the land. So again, the demand is much stronger from a perspective to drive price growth and volume growth over there.Also Read: What Budget 2026 changes mean for NRI real estate investmentsMoving beyond NCR and talking about the stock price, these are things which sometimes even amaze me. If you see our operating performance and some of our metrics, it's a matter of time. If our operating performance continues to be robust, some of these moves are sometimes sentiment-driven. Sometimes these are driven beyond the sector. To be very frank, trade negotiations also impact equity markets in general, and there was a view that this could impact certain sets of businesses.But I think it is a matter of time. Some of the companies that are doing very well in operating performance and are consistently doing that will be recognised. I am proud to say that for the last 10 quarters, we are the only company in Indian real estate that has always done at least ₹5,000 crore or above in booking value. For the last four sequential quarters, we have done ₹7,000 crore and above.So, we have worked on our operating principles very strongly. Stock prices sometimes take time to adjust to the reality of operating performance. And we will, hopefully, see very good performance on the stock market as well, very soon.A fun data point — we were looking back in history, there have probably been five times when the stock has moved downward by 45%, and each of those times, we have come back with about 100% growth within one year and about 200% growth within three years. So, if performance is going to be consistent, it's a matter of time before markets recognise that.Watch the interview in the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

For the December quarter, network gross revenue rose 10% year-on-year to ₹2,608 crore, driven by higher occupied bed days. International patient revenue increased 14% to ₹230 crore and accounted for around 9% of hospital revenue.\nOperating EBITDA grew 4% year-on-year to ₹648 crore, while operating margin declined to 26.1% from 27.3% a year earlier and 26.9% in the previous quarter. The company said margins were impacted by the discontinuation of patented chemotherapy drugs for institutional patients, pre-commissioning expenses related to brownfield bed additions and a change in GST rates.\nDuring the quarter, disruption in cashless services led to a substitution of standalone health insurer patients with PSU patients. Cashless services were restored towards the end of the quarter after settlements, it said. CGHS tariffs were revised in mid-October and are expected to be fully implemented by April 2026. PSUs and government institutions, including ECHS, adopted the revised rates in mid-December.\nOverall EBITDA per bed stood at ₹71.3 lakh, compared with ₹73.0 lakh in Q3 FY25 and ₹73.4 lakh in Q2 FY26. “As per the new CGHS Memorandum of Agreement (MoA), patients are encouraged to procure oncology drugs directly from CGHS outlets and have them administered at empanelled hospitals. However, from a clinical perspective, this practice is not recommended. Under the current reimbursement mechanism, CGHS limits reimbursement for these oncology drugs to 70% of the MRP,\" a company spokesperson told Business Today.\n\"This is not financially viable for private hospitals, as margins on oncology drugs are significantly lower. We have written to CGHS and ECHS highlighting this anomaly and have requested a reconsideration,” the spokesperson said.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

        "full_content": "India’s largest stock exchange, the National Stock Exchange (NSE), reported a sharp 37% year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,408 crore for the third quarter , even as it marked an important regulatory milestone with the receipt of SEBI’s no-objection certificate (NOC) for its long-awaited initial public offering (IPO).\nTotal income for the quarter fell 9% year-on-year to Rs 4,395 crore, primarily due to lower transaction charges. However, on a sequential basis, NSE’s performance showed improvement, with profit after tax rising 15% quarter-on-quarter and total income growing 6%, supported by higher trading volumes.\nThis was the first set of financial results announced by NSE after securing SEBI’s NOC for its IPO, ending a decade-long regulatory overhang.\nNSE’s overall revenue growth during the quarter was impacted by a decline in transaction charges, which fell 12% year-on-year to Rs 3,033 crore. The drop reflected softer activity compared to the high base of the previous year.\nOn a sequential basis, however, transaction revenue rose 9%, aided by a pickup in volumes across the equity cash market and derivatives segments.\nOperating performance also weakened on an annual basis. EBITDA declined 16% year-on-year to ₹2,851 crore, while operating margins slipped to 73%, reflecting the impact of lower revenue and operating leverage.\nOther revenue streams offered some support. Revenue from data feed and terminal services jumped 17% year-on-year to ₹121 crore, while listing services revenue rose 11% to ₹111 crore, highlighting the growing contribution of non-transaction income.\nLast Friday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) granted a formal no-objection certificate to NSE to proceed with its IPO, bringing an end to prolonged delays stemming from governance issues and the co-location controversy.\nAccording to reports, the proposed IPO is likely to be a pure offer for sale (OFS) by existing shareholders and could hit the markets within the next seven to eight months. NSE’s board is expected to constitute a specialised committee to oversee the listing process. The committee will define listing procedures and set criteria for appointing merchant bankers and legal advisors to prepare the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP).\nThe IPO is expected to be among the largest in India’s capital markets. NSE currently has around 1.77 lakh shareholders and is estimated to be valued at over Rs 5 lakh crore in the grey market, according to analysts.\nNSE’s listing plans have been on hold since 2016, when the exchange first filed draft offer documents to raise around Rs 10,000 crore through an offer for sale. SEBI withheld approval at the time due to regulatory concerns linked to governance lapses and allegations of unfair market access through the co-location facility.\nThe exchange has since approached the regulator multiple times seeking clearance. A key breakthrough came last month when SEBI Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the regulator had granted in-principle approval to NSE’s settlement application in the co-location case, a move widely seen as clearing the path for the IPO.\nNSE filed its settlement plea in June 2025 and later offered to pay Rs 1,388 crore to settle the charges related to the unfair access case.\nNSE Managing Director and CEO Ashish Kumar Chauhan had earlier described the in-principle approval as a positive signal, noting that once the NOC was received, the exchange would begin preparations for filing the DRHP. He had indicated that filing the DRHP could take up to four months, followed by regulatory review.\nWith the NOC now in hand, NSE’s long-delayed listing appears firmly back on track, even as near-term financial performance reflects moderation from last year’s elevated levels.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

The drop is attributed to IndiGo’s 10% capacity cut imposed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).\nRichard Evans, Senior Consultant, Cirium Ascend Consultancy, said the firm’s October 2025 forecast projected that India’s aviation market will grow at 10% per annum for the next decade.\n“However, India is down (growth) for April 2026 because of the Indigo schedule meltdown. There is a capacity cut, and we don’t know how long it will continue. Domestic schedule is not growing, and airfares will go up in the market,” said Evans.\nThe Ministry of Civil Aviation has capped the airfare post the IndiGo episode, but is likely to take a call on it with the summer schedule kicking in April onwards. Airfares in India are market-driven and not regulated by the government.\nIndiGo saw cancellation of over 5689 flights in early December after the new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms kicked in from November 2025 onwards. With thousands of passengers stranded due to IndiGo cancellations, the DGCA gave the airline a one-time FDTL relaxation till Feb 10.\nIndiGo is also under the Competition Commission of India (CCI) scanner for abuse of market dominance, having a 65% market share. The low-cost carrier’s net profit nosedived by 77.6% to Rs 549.8 crore, compared to Rs 2,448.8 crore in Q3FY26, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal.\nThe airline’s financials were severely impacted by exceptional items aggregating to Rs 1,546.5 crore during the quarter. This included a significant provision of Rs 969.3 crore towards the implementation of new labour laws.\nAdditionally, the company absorbed costs of Rs 555 crore related to operational disruptions and a penalty of Rs 22.2 crore imposed by the DGCA. The airline faced major service disruptions in early December, which resulted in flight cancellations and delays.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today.

        "full_content": "Reliance shares have been enjoying healthy buying interest this month so far. Reliance Industries (RIL) share price climbed by nearly 1% in morning trade on the BSE on Monday, February 9, rising for the second consecutive session. On a monthly scale, the stock has risen by almost 5% in February so far after suffering a significant loss of 11% in January.\nRIL shares hit their record high of ₹ 1,611.20 on January 5 this year. Experts appear bullish on the stock for the long term due to the company's bright growth prospects.\nThe stock is expected to see a healthy short-term uptrend, too, as market sentiment improves following an India-US trade deal .\n\"The India-US trade deal is positive for this heavyweight stock because the overhang was largely due to this event, especially in comparison to our neighbouring countries. The deal has turned out to be positive, though only the initial details are out,\" said Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking.\nOn January 16, the Mukesh Ambani-owned oil-to-telecom-to-retail conglomerate reported a nearly 2% year-on-year (YoY) rise in its consolidated profit to ₹ 22,167 crore for Q3FY26.\nConsolidated revenue from operations rose 10.51% YoY to ₹ 2,69,496 crore. Consolidated EBITDA rose 6.1% YoY to ₹ 50,932 crore, but EBITDA margin shrank by 70 bps YoY to 17.3% for Q3FY26.\nExperts appear largely bullish on the stock. Mishra of Religare Broking has a buy recommendation on the stock with a target price of ₹ 1,627.\nSeema Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities, has a positive view on the stock. She pointed out that Reliance represents a rare blend of scale, strategic optionality, and execution capability across multiple economic cycles.\n\"Its diversified portfolio across energy, digital services, retail, media and emerging new energy positions the company as a core proxy for India’s structural growth story. The sustained capex intensity in FY26 reflects a deliberate transition from legacy cash-generating businesses toward future engines of value creation, particularly in new energy, digital infrastructure, and AI-led services,\" Srivastava said.\nSrivastava underscored that Jio Platforms continues to strengthen its leadership with rising ARPU, deepening 5G adoption, and expanding broadband reach, which enhances monetisation potential while reinforcing high entry barriers.\nThe collaboration with Google on AI meaningfully elevates Jio’s positioning, enabling Reliance to embed AI capabilities across consumer and enterprise offerings at scale, potentially opening new revenue pools over the next decade.\nSrivastava added that Reliance Retail remains a formidable growth pillar, benefiting from unmatched distribution, rapid store expansion, and rising consumer engagement, with hyper-local delivery and omnichannel capabilities improving unit economics and customer stickiness.\n\"While risks such as macroeconomic slowdown and upstream volatility persist, Reliance’s balance sheet strength, integrated ecosystem, and ability to pivot capital toward high-return opportunities mitigate downside risks,\" said Srivastava.\n\"Overall, Reliance Industries is evolving from a cyclical conglomerate into a platform-driven enterprise, offering long-term investors a combination of steady cash flows, emerging growth opportunities, and sustained compounding potential aligned with India’s economic and digital transformation,\" Srivastava said.\nNot only fundamentals, but technical indicators also suggest the stock is poised for a healthy upside.\nJigar S. Patel, Senior Manager of Equity Technical Research at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, highlighted that Reliance shares are currently trading in a consolidation phase, caught between its 200-day exponential moving average (200 DEMA) and 200-day simple moving average (200 DSMA), as seen on the chart. This indicates a temporary equilibrium between buyers and sellers after recent volatility.\nPatel said an unfilled gap in the ₹ 1,390–1,395 zone is likely to act as a strong near-term support, as gap areas often attract buying interest during pullbacks.\nAdding to the positive bias, the MACD has delivered a bullish crossover from extremely low levels — a pattern not seen since November 2024 — signalling a potential shift in momentum. Such crossovers at depressed levels generally suggest strengthening upside probability and the possibility of trend resumption.\n\"Considering these technical factors, the outlook appears constructive. Investors may consider accumulating the stock in the ₹ 1,390–1,430 range, with an upside target of ₹ 1,530 and a stop loss placed at ₹ 1,360 on a closing basis to manage risk effectively,\" said Patel.\nAakash Shah, a research analyst at Choice Broking, too, has a positive view on the stock.\nShah underscored that Reliance's price action shows a recovery attempt with the stock reclaiming the 20 EMA and stabilising near the 50 EMA, reflecting improving short-term momentum.\nThe 100 EMA is positioned slightly above the current price and is acting as an intermediate resistance zone. Sustained acceptance above this level would be an important signal for broader bullish continuation, said Shah.\nThe moving average structure is beginning to flatten, suggesting that bearish momentum is losing strength. RSI has rebounded back above the 50 zone, indicating improving momentum and early accumulation behaviour after the recent decline.\n\"Structurally, the recent swing low near ₹ 1,380 now acts as a critical demand zone. As long as price holds above this base, the recovery structure remains valid and favours continuation toward the overhead supply and resistance zone near ₹ 1,580,\" said Shah.\nRead all market-related news here\nRead more stories by Nishant Kumar",

Motilal Oswal matched the ₹1,300 target, valuing the lender at 1.4 times fiscal 2028 adjusted book value plus ₹354 for subsidiaries, while raising earnings estimates by 3% and 4.3% for fiscal 2027-28. The brokerage projected fiscal 2027 return on assets and return on equity at 1.1% and 15.9%, respectively. \"Asset quality improved further, with slippages moderating and credit cost staying benign at 29bp,\" Motilal Oswal said. \"The bank sounded confident about the overall credit environment.\" Live Events Net interest income grew 9% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter to ₹45,190 crore, in line with estimates. Net interest margin stood at 2.99%, a 2-basis-point sequential improvement, with domestic margins expanding 3 basis points to 3.12%. The bank expects margins above 3% in fiscal 2026 and the long term. Nomura raised its target price to ₹1,235 from ₹1,100, valuing the core bank at 1.4 times December 2027 book value per share, up from 1.3 times previously, with subsidiaries contributing ₹250 per share. \"The higher target multiple reflects an improved RoE outlook,\" the brokerage said. JP Morgan maintained its Overweight rating and lifted its September 2027 price target 2.5% to ₹1,250 from ₹1,220, revising fiscal 2026 earnings estimates by 7% while keeping fiscal 2027-28 forecasts broadly unchanged. \"SBI's results reinforce our positive thesis: the bank is delivering above-system growth, maintaining best-in-class asset quality, and expanding profitability,\" JP Morgan said. Morgan Stanley kept its equal weight stance, raising fiscal 2026 earnings estimates by 8% given the strong third quarter but maintaining fiscal 2027-28 forecasts. The brokerage cited near-full valuations, with its target implying 1.3 times core fiscal 2027 book value, noting better-than-expected revenue growth would be a key upside catalyst. BofA Securities struck a more cautious note, maintaining its Neutral rating with a new price objective of ₹1,100 from ₹1,050, revising earnings per share estimates up 5-9% on improved growth and margin assumptions. \"At current valuations (FY27E standalone PB 1.2x and PE 9x), we see risk-reward is roughly balanced,\" BofA said. \"We see scope for mid-cap PSBs to narrow their valuation discount with SBI.\" The loan book grew 15.6% year-on-year and 6.1% quarter-on-quarter, while deposits expanded 9% and 2%, respectively.

        "full_content": "Shares of IDBI Bank slipped as much as 4% to an intraday low of Rs 103 amid developments around the planned strategic sale of the state-owned lender. The disinvestment process has attracted bids from Indian-Canadian investor Prema Watsa’s Fairfax Financial and Emirates NBD. The government of India and Life Insurance Corporation of India ( LIC ), which hold stakes of 45.48% and 49.24% respectively, are together looking to divest a 60.7% stake in the bank as part of the broader privatisation programme. Meanwhile, Kotak Mahindra Bank clarified that it has not submitted a financial bid for IDBI Bank, dismissing recent media reports. The proposed sale was first announced in 2022, and the government is targeting to announce the successful bidder by March. The bank has a current market capitalisation of around Rs 1.12 lakh crore. According to sources cited by Reuters, Fairfax — which already holds a majority stake in CSB Bank — may consider merging IDBI Bank with CSB Bank if its bid is successful. The government has previously said the sale will be concluded in the current financial year ending March 31, 2026. The successful bidder will be allowed to rename the bank, Reuters reported last week. Live Events IDBI Bank traces its origins to 1964, when it was established as the Industrial Development Bank of India through an Act of Parliament to support long-term industrial financing. In 2005, its commercial banking arm was fully merged into the institution, transforming it into a universal bank with both development finance and lending operations. Over time, however, this dual structure became a challenge, as the bank retained a heavy corporate lending focus even as peers diversified into retail segments, leaving it more exposed to concentrated risks and with limited balance from granular retail growth. By the mid-2010s, mounting bad loans and weak capital buffers had significantly strained the bank’s financial position. In 2017, the Reserve Bank of India placed IDBI under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework after it breached key thresholds related to capital adequacy, asset quality, return on assets and leverage. The restrictions under PCA curtailed lending expansion and underscored the severity of the bank’s operational and balance-sheet stress. The situation reached a turning point in 2019 when the government directed Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to acquire a controlling 51% stake and infuse capital to stabilise the lender. LIC’s takeover strengthened the balance sheet and reflected a clear policy decision to support the institution. Following the transaction, the RBI reclassified IDBI as a private sector bank for regulatory purposes, despite the continued majority ownership by government-linked entities. IDBI Bank shares have risen 31.23% in the last 1 year. (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "full_content": "Shares of IDBI Bank slipped as much as 4% to an intraday low of Rs 103 amid developments around the planned strategic sale of the state-owned lender. The disinvestment process has attracted bids from Indian-Canadian investor Prema Watsa’s Fairfax Financial and Emirates NBD. The government of India and Life Insurance Corporation of India ( LIC ), which hold stakes of 45.48% and 49.24% respectively, are together looking to divest a 60.7% stake in the bank as part of the broader privatisation programme. Meanwhile, Kotak Mahindra Bank clarified that it has not submitted a financial bid for IDBI Bank, dismissing recent media reports. The proposed sale was first announced in 2022, and the government is targeting to announce the successful bidder by March. The bank has a current market capitalisation of around Rs 1.12 lakh crore. According to sources cited by Reuters, Fairfax — which already holds a majority stake in CSB Bank — may consider merging IDBI Bank with CSB Bank if its bid is successful. The government has previously said the sale will be concluded in the current financial year ending March 31, 2026. The successful bidder will be allowed to rename the bank, Reuters reported last week. Live Events IDBI Bank traces its origins to 1964, when it was established as the Industrial Development Bank of India through an Act of Parliament to support long-term industrial financing. In 2005, its commercial banking arm was fully merged into the institution, transforming it into a universal bank with both development finance and lending operations. Over time, however, this dual structure became a challenge, as the bank retained a heavy corporate lending focus even as peers diversified into retail segments, leaving it more exposed to concentrated risks and with limited balance from granular retail growth. By the mid-2010s, mounting bad loans and weak capital buffers had significantly strained the bank’s financial position. In 2017, the Reserve Bank of India placed IDBI under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework after it breached key thresholds related to capital adequacy, asset quality, return on assets and leverage. The restrictions under PCA curtailed lending expansion and underscored the severity of the bank’s operational and balance-sheet stress. The situation reached a turning point in 2019 when the government directed Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to acquire a controlling 51% stake and infuse capital to stabilise the lender. LIC’s takeover strengthened the balance sheet and reflected a clear policy decision to support the institution. Following the transaction, the RBI reclassified IDBI as a private sector bank for regulatory purposes, despite the continued majority ownership by government-linked entities. IDBI Bank shares have risen 31.23% in the last 1 year. (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The brokerage expects the margin to improve following the US decision to lower reciprocal tariffs on Indian exports from 25% to 18%, along with the removal of the additional punitive 25% tariff, which it believes will be margin-accretive.The brokerage expects growth momentum to sustain, particularly in North America, supported by a recovery in demand from telecom operators and hyperscalers, easing trade conditions, Sterlite Tech’s local manufacturing footprint, and a sharper focus on its data centre portfolio.As per Bloomberg consensus data, Sterlite Tech has a consensus rating of 4.33, with 66.7% of analysts recommending ‘Buy’ and the remaining 33.3% maintaining a ‘Hold’. The consensus 12-month target price stands at ₹155.5, implying an upside of around 11% from the last traded price of ₹140.3.Among brokerages tracking the stock, Nuvama currently has the highest target price at ₹200, while other bullish calls include Maybank Investment Banking with a target of ₹215 and Equirus Securities at ₹226.The stock has delivered a one-year return of nearly 80%.Sterlite Tech reported a net loss of ₹17 crore in Q3FY26, compared with a net loss of ₹24 crore in the corresponding period last year.

The brokerage expects the margin to improve following the US decision to lower reciprocal tariffs on Indian exports from 25% to 18%, along with the removal of the additional punitive 25% tariff, which it believes will be margin-accretive.The brokerage expects growth momentum to sustain, particularly in North America, supported by a recovery in demand from telecom operators and hyperscalers, easing trade conditions, Sterlite Tech’s local manufacturing footprint, and a sharper focus on its data centre portfolio.As per Bloomberg consensus data, Sterlite Tech has a consensus rating of 4.33, with 66.7% of analysts recommending ‘Buy’ and the remaining 33.3% maintaining a ‘Hold’. The consensus 12-month target price stands at ₹155.5, implying an upside of around 11% from the last traded price of ₹140.3.Among brokerages tracking the stock, Nuvama currently has the highest target price at ₹200, while other bullish calls include Maybank Investment Banking with a target of ₹215 and Equirus Securities at ₹226.The stock has delivered a one-year return of nearly 80%.Sterlite Tech reported a net loss of ₹17 crore in Q3FY26, compared with a net loss of ₹24 crore in the corresponding period last year.

However, the goal is “subject to the market growing at 8%,” he noted.“7% , and if the government's focus on infrastructure spending, as seen in the Budget, continues, we think the market can grow still faster. Overall, about 10% can be Shree Cement’s growth,” he added.The company has moved past its earlier strategy of prioritising value over volumes and has successfully narrowed pricing gaps with peers, he said.“This quarter, we will be getting both value and volume. Now volumes have started coming, and value, which we had to sacrifice for volume for the last three quarters, that sacrifice part is over,\" he said.The company recently reported its October–December 2025 quarter results, where net profit rose 37.9% year-on-year to ₹266.7 crore, compared with ₹193.4 crore in the same period last year.Shree Cement currently has a market capitalisation of ₹96,443.84 crore. The company’s shares have declined more than 4% over the past one year.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: In the last quarter, was the strategy the same, going for value over volume? What is the strategy from here on, what kind of volume growth are you estimating for quarter four, and what would that mean in terms of the yearly growth and for FY27? A: The strategy which we have been following for the last eight to nine months, that is almost through, and it has been successfully done. This quarter, we will be getting both value and volume. Now volumes have started coming, and value, which we had to sacrifice for volume for the last three quarters, that sacrifice part is over.Initially, the public and the dealers didn't expect that this could be sustainable. We were under pressure. But this quarter, for the first one and a half months, up to February 10, our volumes are definitely better than the same quarter last year. And it is a commodity; we don't know what will happen tomorrow. I will say very modest, a 5-8% jump in volume with a good jump in prices.Q: So, by the end of this year, you land closer to around, something in the vicinity of around 36 to 36.5 million tonne. Will that be a fair estimate?A: Yes, 36.5-37 million tonne will be the estimate.Q: What about prices? Your maximum exposure is in the North, followed by the East and then the South. What has been the price change on average for quarter four, if we compare it to quarter three? I understand that price increases have now been absorbed. A: Yes, we try to price multiple times. Sometimes it gets absorbed. But about a ₹10 to ₹15 price increase. In terms of percentage, it will be 4 to 5%, but ₹10 to ₹15 is a good price rise.Q: Besides the volume growth being a bit of a disappointment, what's encouraging is that you have managed to bridge that price gap, let's say with UltraTech Cement. Earlier, the price gap was around ₹30. That's down to around ₹15. So, are you satisfied on that front now? Also, could you tell us, observing that non-trade as a percentage of the mix had moved up, do you believe that this will reduce again, and you focus again on trade?A: The prices are different, but it creates so much margin, and there is so much distribution cost. So, in non-trade, the EBITDA is almost the same. So, trade or non-trade hardly makes a difference. Now, ₹13 to ₹15 is the fair estimate. This has come down, and now, as I was saying in the very first opening line, the volumes are also coming back. So now we will be having the best of both worlds.Q: And the best of both worlds means in quarter four, you get back to around ₹1,200 to ₹1,250 per tonne of EBITDA. Would that be a fair estimate? Why I'm asking you about that is, see, prices have gone up by around 3 to 4%, volume growth is going to come back. So, you'll have operating leverage. You'll also have pricing benefits and input costs - you have focused a lot out there. So, give and take everything, ₹150 to ₹200 price improvement in quarter four could be par for the course.A: Yes, of course, this will be about ₹150 to ₹200, and ₹1,200 EBITDA per tonne is not far off.Q: I want to ask you about the profitability. In the North, you have been strong with regard to market share and the way you're focused on cost as well. Could you tell us, what is the EBITDA per tonne difference if I compare the North and the South? A: The North would be relatively about ₹500 higher in comparison to the South.Q: But the problem is that in North India you will have a few more players coming. JSW Cement has shown some aggression. UltraTech is adding capacity, JK Cement as well as Wonder Cement. So, the Street believes that your dominance in North India is going to be challenged. What do you have to say to that?A: Yes, dominance in North India will definitely be challenged. Right now, if you have 20% market share, if you come down to 16%, that is alright. But the point is, our volumes will increase. The demand is much more. India, when it was growing at 7%, had 30 million tonne in North India. Now it is growing at 7% at 100 million tonne in North India. So, every year, demand will increase by 7 million tonne. So, 4 to 5 million tonne of additional production is not going to matter much.Also Read | Cement, metals, banks: Dharmesh Kant’s playbook for the next 6–9 monthsQ: You believe everyone will prosper?A: Yes, we will also prosper.Q: What do you have to say about UltraTech Cement talking up the South industry? They are saying the South is the new North. Do you believe, indeed, the South is doing better?A: Only about a minute back, I had said North Indian profits are ₹500 higher. In the future, nobody knows how it will turn out tomorrow. Yes, it may be possible, may not be possible, but we have to see. We don't say anything definitively.Q: You will have to do something to excite the Street. You're sitting on a good amount of cash, and in the past, you have said you want to grow organically. But with this cash that you have in the books, do you think you can give a higher dividend? If yes, how much does the dividend payout ratio go up by? Or do you think you could also look to consider a buyback?A: No, buyback will not be there. There is no requirement for a buyback. We will increase the dividend a little. And in the fourth quarter, things will be exciting. The numbers will excite. We don't have to keep exciting every quarter, every year, but this quarter will be good. That's all I can say.Q: You have narrowed the pricing gap with the leader and you're sounding far more optimistic in quarter four. So, what would be your estimate of volume growth for FY27?A: In FY26, we had grown less than the market. Yes, but in FY27, our growth will be higher than the average market growth. That's all I can say.Q: And you're expecting the market to grow at around 6 to 7%?A: 7%, and if the government's focus on infrastructure spending as seen in the Budget continues, we think the market can grow still faster. Overall, about 10% can be attributed to Shree Cement’s growth.Q: 10% growth for next year?A: Subject to the market growing at 8%.For the full interview, watch the accompanying videoCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

That's what we're seeing at this point in time.Q: I wanted to understand from a business standpoint, given the sort of conversations around AI, the new developments that are taking place globally as well, for a business like yours, what proportion of your revenue gets impacted by AI in the sense that AI capabilities can do that a lot better than what you are currently offering, or and concomitantly on your cost business, what proportion of AI can reduce your cost? But Sonata business is far more complex on modernisation and regulated industry perspective so we feel at this at this point in time, we are moving forward, embracing the changes that are happening in the industry, helping clients deliver faster, but really keeping a watchful eye on the future as well, because this technology still is evolving at this point in time.Q: In your third quarter numbers, there's a bit of a mixed bag when you look at the sectoral contribution. AI order book is increasing in a very healthy manner, which is much in line with their expectations.Now from a sectoral perspective, clearly we had large client issue in banking and a large client issue in Technology, Media and Telecom , so that's why the sectoral performances look not so good on those two sectors, just because of the two specific clients issue we had.In retail manufacturing, much in line what we have been saying, our tariff have been hitting us. So overall, very bullish about healthcare business, very bullish about where banking businesses, except for one client issue we have, and that's how the quarter came out for us.Q: Just for bookkeeping, if you could tell us a couple of things, the TMT, which is technology, media, telecom, HLS - healthcare and life sciences and RMD - retail, manufacturing, travel and distribution, how much do they contribute in terms of your current revenue, and what is their contribution in terms of your order book?",
        "full_content": "Artificial Intelligence-led engagements are emerging as a key growth driver for Bengaluru-based technology services company Sonata Software, with AI now forming a steadily rising share of its order book.Samir Dhir, MD &amp; CEO, Sonata Software, highlighted that demand is increasingly centred on using AI to accelerate delivery timelines and improving productivity, particularly in complex modernisation programmes. This is helping the company execute projects faster without diluting pricing, supporting margin stability even in a cautious global tech spending environment.Beyond AI, the company’s forward outlook is anchored in structurally strong and regulated verticals such as healthcare and BFSI. These businesses, built and scaled over the last few years, now contribute a meaningful share of both revenues and the order pipeline.Management remains optimistic about these segments, citing sustained demand and long-term deal visibility, which continues to offset softness in select client accounts.In the October–December quarter , Sonata Software reported revenue of ₹3,080 crore, profit of ₹104 crore, and margins of 5.21%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: What about the AI led engagements? They are now about 14% of your order book versus 10% is what you told us the quarter before. How do you see this mix rising over the year? What kind of contributions do you see from this segment and which verticals are driving up the demand for AI?A: We are not surprised with this, we have talked about it earlier. We said in three years, we think our AI order book should be around 20-25% and we are getting this sooner than we anticipated, which is nice. It's a secular trend that we see across our clients. Clients are asking us to use AI to deliver time to market faster. So as an example, one of our clients we're doing work, which is a modernisation program, they wanted to they wanted to move from an older platform to a new technology, which probably would have taken about 12 to 15 months in prior times. But because our teams could bring in the agentic thinking and the AI thinking into the program, we are able to deliver in about 30 to 40% lesser time than we have had anticipated before.Now the price of the project is still the same, but you're just delivering that in an accelerated manner, because the tools exist today to deliver time to market faster. So, bulk of the changes in the project that we are seeing in our 14% order book that you mentioned, they are in the realm of delivering customers faster outcomes in a faster timeline basis, then really impact on the topline. That's what we're seeing at this point in time.Q: I wanted to understand from a business standpoint, given the sort of conversations around AI, the new developments that are taking place globally as well, for a business like yours, what proportion of your revenue gets impacted by AI in the sense that AI capabilities can do that a lot better than what you are currently offering, or and concomitantly on your cost business, what proportion of AI can reduce your cost? So, what the net impact of artificial intelligence could be in terms of replaced and incremental revenue and replaced and incremental costs?A: We are a specialist firm in modernisation engineering. Generally speaking, we move customers from old technologies to newer platforms, and we do that in a very regulated industry model, which is banking, financial services, healthcare. They are highly regulated industries, there is a lot of premium on data sensitivity. There's a lot of premium on understanding the context of the old code bases and then migrating them to the newer platforms.At this point in time, candidly, we don't see a significant impact of any of the tools that even got launched last week or even prior, impacting that modernisation type of work that we end up doing for our customers. Having said that, it's an area that we are watching, we remain watchful. We do see productivity benefits coming out of AI, much in line with our industry peers, and that's what we are seeing. But in general, the demand from our customers and all the automobile that we talked to you about is to go faster, but not cheaper. That's not what we're seeing at this point in time.And because we are largely operating regulated industry environment, we don't believe the tools that are being launched right now have an impact on those industry segments. But Sonata business is far more complex on modernisation and regulated industry perspective so we feel at this at this point in time, we are moving forward, embracing the changes that are happening in the industry, helping clients deliver faster, but really keeping a watchful eye on the future as well, because this technology still is evolving at this point in time.Q: In your third quarter numbers, there's a bit of a mixed bag when you look at the sectoral contribution. On one hand, you had retail healthcare grow despite you telling us previously that tariffs had impacted the retail sector. BFSI continues to come down, telecom, media, technology, also, it stayed soft in the quarter. Now, as you are closing the year, if you could give us a guidance on what the full year FY26 growth would look like, and where are the segments where you are continuing to see ramped down by clients?A: Overall, we had a good quarter. We delivered PAT growth of profit after tax, growth of 21.4% year-on-year, and a sequential growth of 6.1% so we are very pleased with the performance that in this environment we could deliver 20% plus PAT growth year-on-year basis. Our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation  outside the one time exception that we would take because of the labour code, also accreted in the quarter, from 17.3% a quarter prior to about 19.5% in this quarter. Overall, from a profitability perspective, had a very solid, robust performance, and much in line with what we have guided earlier, that we want to be a high-teens and a low 20s EBITDA company, so very good with that.On the domestic business as well, we had a pretty strong showing. Our gross contribution improved quarter-on-quarter basis, 10.8% which was a concern that we all had given the Microsoft and some of the larger OEM going direct issue. I think we delivered a seasonally strong quarter on the SITL as well. And you are right I think from a AI perspective, we have been making steady progress. Our order book for the quarter was about 14% of the total order book. AI order book is increasing in a very healthy manner, which is much in line with their expectations.Now from a sectoral perspective, clearly we had large client issue in banking and a large client issue in Technology, Media and Telecom , so that's why the sectoral performances look not so good on those two sectors, just because of the two specific clients issue we had.In retail manufacturing, much in line what we have been saying, our tariff have been hitting us. There is some one-time benefit we got in the quarter, but I think going into next quarter will continue to see retail manufacturing will be not growing to the extent that you saw in the in the current quarter. So overall, very bullish about healthcare business, very bullish about where banking businesses, except for one client issue we have, and that's how the quarter came out for us.Q: Just for bookkeeping, if you could tell us a couple of things, the TMT, which is technology, media, telecom, HLS - healthcare and life sciences and RMD - retail, manufacturing, travel and distribution, how much do they contribute in terms of your current revenue, and what is their contribution in terms of your order book? So that we get a trend on where this is likely to go from here onA: Healthcare, life sciences and banking, financials, is the new verticals we created about three, four years back, they contribute about 9% of our total business back in 2023, they contribute now roughly about 30% of our business together, BFSI and healthcare together. Bulk of our out of book, I would say 60 to 70% order book continues to be in these two verticals. And that trend, we think is a secular trend that we will continue to see.TMT outside the large client is a smaller book of business and retail manufacturing, like we mentioned earlier, is under pressure because of the whole tariff situation that is currently going on. It will probably just hold flat to what you are seeing at this point in time. That's our current expectation.Sonata Software’s current market capitalisation is ₹8,660.92 crore.

Thangamayil Jewellery gained 6.08 per cent, while P N Gadgil Jewellers and Senco Gold advanced 5.38 per cent and 4.40 per cent, respectively.\nSome market analysts attributed the strong uptick to a combination of improving sentiment following the India–US interim trade deal and a recent correction in gold prices from record highs.\nKranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist at WealthMills Securities, said some buying interest is emerging in physical gold jewellers as the precious metal has corrected from its peak. He added that the India–US trade deal has also lifted sentiment, which is reflected in the rise in jewellery stocks.\nG Chokkalingam, Managing Director – Research at Equinomics, said high precious metal prices are expected to reduce jewellery demand, leading to a negative short-term outlook. He added that jewellers with substantial inventories of gold bought at lower prices a few months ago could use those stocks to deliver better performance in the near term.\nMeanwhile, domestic equity benchmarks were trading higher, gaining around 0.5 per cent, supported by positive global cues. The broader market outperformed the frontline indices, with the Nifty Midcap index rising 1.29 per cent and the Nifty Smallcap index surging 2.08 per cent.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

He expects margins to improve from here as these exceptional costs fall away and the newly acquired subsidiaries scale up and improve their profitability.Baid remains optimistic about the next financial year, with subsidiaries expected to contribute more meaningfully and export markets in Europe and the US reopening after earlier delays.Europe is already showing signs of improvement, and export growth of 12–15% is currently visible, with clearer guidance expected by the end of the fourth quarter.In October-December quarter , Poly Medicure reported a revenue of ₹493 crore, profit of ₹70 crore and margins of 23%.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: This year is going to be obviously a lower than estimated growth. This was a one-off quarter on a consolidated basis, the net margin level, but in terms of gross margins, we have improved by actually 200-300 basis points in the current quarter.Q: Margin should get back to 25-27% and on the topline you maintain the 15 to 16% growth guidance?A: If you see a current quarter, we have done close to 15-16% growth from the previous quarter, and this quarter also will see a similar number. Next year also, we should see a similar growth unless, until there is a big change in the duty structure, or there is something intervention by the government, we don't see moving back to that 35-40% number.Q: Have you reached out to the government, for some sort of protection against dumping by China on renal products?A: We have reached out and we are working on that. Hopefully government is working on it and we will see something in next few months coming up.Q: On this India US trade deal for medtech products, the tariff has been cut from 15 to 18% if you could give perspective on the industry, what percentage is India's exports to the US from an industry point of view, how would it compare with, say, you know, from a country like China?",

As you said, the first couple of quarters were rough, and it appears most of the growth has come in because of the acquisition. Now, given that the acquisition will be fully available for the entire of FY27 what kind of growth are you looking at if you break it up between the exports as well as the domestic market, because there was some softness even in the domestic market?A: So domestic market, has grown around 22.50%. If you look at the private market, it is almost 90% of our business. Government business, there was a deliberate attempt to make it slightly lower, because of the margin pressure there. So overall, we have grown 18% close to 18% on the domestic business. But a private business which is 90% has grown around has grown around 22%.Hopefully, we will end the year, roughly overall growth in the domestic business close to 21-22%, but private business will grow by around 25%. When you look at next year, we have not guided fully, but next year we should grow back. The subsidiaries will start kicking, in export business, which was stalled a little bit in Europe and US, the trade deal is signed. So now we are back on track. Hopefully, the contracts which were stalled will come back very quickly, we are working on them.Europe market seems to be looking better now, much better than before. So, export business will show a growth of between 12 to 15% that's what we see right now, but I think we will quantify the numbers at end of quarter four.Q: Your margins have contracted on a year on year basis. What led to that, and what is the guidance on margins? Was this a one off, do margins recover back again in quarter four or are lower margins going to be the new normal for the company?A: This was a one-off situation. We had almost ₹7 crore of new labour code impact, of around ₹9-9.5 crore of acquisition costs were absorbed in quarter three. So, barring that, if you look at standalone numbers, we did EBITDA of 26.8%, if we combine it on the whole consolidated basis, it was around 24.2% because the subsidiaries, the acquisitions we did, have started kicking in. Of course, they operated lower EBITDA margin right now because we've just acquired these companies. But as we go along, they will also increase their margins. This was a one-off quarter on a consolidated basis, the net margin level, but in terms of gross margins, we have improved by actually 200-300 basis points in the current quarter.Q: Margin should get back to 25-27% and on the topline you maintain the 15 to 16% growth guidance?A: If you see a current quarter, we have done close to 15-16% growth from the previous quarter, and this quarter also will see a similar number. As we told earlier, between H1 and H2 we will see a 20% growth, because first few quarters were really down because of international revenue, but international revenue will has started coming back. We will end the year between H1 and H2 with a 20% growth. But of course, next year looks more promising.Q: You have scaled down your dialysis machine sales. Earlier, you were looking at 500 to 550 that's around 450 odd. Are you confident about meeting this revised guidance? And how do you see that trajectory move from year on, in terms of number of machines, if you could tell us, 27, 28 onwards, and also the Renal business, that is a smaller part of your business, but you were quite optimistic on growth out there. So what revenue is this year, next year, and how do you see that shaping up?A: The renal business has taken a small dip, mainly because of, dumping from Chinese companies. I have been talking constantly about it, and because of the FTAs they have been using nearby countries like Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, to dump products in India at zero duty. That is what is hurting the industry - number one.Number two, on the machine side, also we have a similar problem because, some of those equipment’s are coming from those countries and with a zero duty and that is also hurting our manufacturing here. So currently, we should end the year with around 25 to 28% growth.Nine months, we are down close to around 25% growth. But we should end around 25 to 28% growth for the whole year. Next year also, we should see a similar growth unless, until there is a big change in the duty structure, or there is something intervention by the government, we don't see moving back to that 35-40% number.Q: Have you reached out to the government, for some sort of protection against dumping by China on renal products?A: We have reached out and we are working on that. We have, raised that issue at different levels, the commerce ministry and with the pharmaceutical ministry.Q: How much cheaper are the Chinese products versus, say, Poly Medicure?A: The bigger problem is they have been selling below the import price, that's a bigger concern that, how could somebody sell a product in India below the import cost? I think that is a concern we have raised with the government. Hopefully government is working on it and we will see something in next few months coming up.Q: On this India US trade deal for medtech products, the tariff has been cut from 15 to 18% if you could give perspective on the industry, what percentage is India's exports to the US from an industry point of view, how would it compare with, say, you know, from a country like China? And then lay out the impact for Poly Medicure because I think for you US, exports are still very small?A: If you see from India's total export basket of $4 billion, US export was close to around $750 million and mainly these are large equipment’s. Probably larger companies are exporting some equipment’s back to US. Consumer export is still not very high, but with the trade deal signed, what I see is a major impact coming in the medtech industry, because many because many projects were stalled, and we lost many opportunities to countries like Malaysia, Vietnam and maybe Thailand, because they had lower tariffs compared to India. So, no new projects were coming, and most of the projects got stalled.This is a very, very positive move, even for us, because we have almost 10 to 15 products in pipeline, which were on the verge of getting into the US market. So hopefully, we will start working on them and the companies we were working with, they will come back very quickly to us on that. And also, we get more competitive with China, for sure in terms of like to like basis.For full interview, watch accompanying videoLive stock market updates—follow our blog",

Under the agreement, Lupin and its US unit will pay Astellas a $75 million upfront payment and per-unit licensing fees on Mirabegron sales through September 2027, the company said in an exchange filing. In a separate statement, the Japanese drugmaker said the settlement concludes its litigation with Lupin and added that it is reviewing the potential financial impact for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026. Lupin had previously disclosed the patent dispute with Astellas last April over its generic version of Myrbetriq, Astellas' overactive bladder drug, after a U.S. court ruling raised the risk that generic versions could be withdrawn from the market.",

        "full_content": "Punit Lalbhai, Vice Chairman, Arvind Ltd\nArvind Website\nA destabilised Bangladesh could hurt Gujarat-based textile manufacturer Arvind Ltd in the short term but also create an opening for India’s apparel ambitions, Vice Chairman Punit Lalbhai said.\n“In the short term, disruption in Bangladesh is not good for Arvind. For India, it is a huge opportunity. And I’m a patriot. So, I want India to grow. And I don’t want Bangladesh to suffer,” Lalbhai said, noting that Bangladesh remains a key end market for the company’s fabric business and that Arvind has a “high dependency” on India’s eastern neighbour.\n“I think a destabilised Bangladesh is more a risk than an opportunity for us because our garment business is still relatively small compared to our fabric portfolio. Bangladesh is today a key end market for our fabrics. So, if there is disruption in the Bangladesh market for whatever reason, it’s not great news for us. We want a stable Bangladesh,” he told investors recently. He said Arvind’s garment exposure in Bangladesh is smaller than its fabric business, though the company has reduced its dependence over recent years. “Almost all of our export denim used to go to Bangladesh. Now, it is far better distributed. Bangladesh is still important, but there are newer geographies where our denim is going,” he added.\nHighlighting the divergence between company-level risk and national opportunity, Lalbhai said a Bangladesh slowdown could also soften yarn prices, creating mixed outcomes for the industry. “It could be an opportunity on the yarn side because yarn prices will go down, but that’s not good for India because we have a lot of yarn capacity that has come up. So sometimes what is good for the whole industry and what is good for an individual player is not the same thing,” he said.\nOver the longer term, India needs to expand garmenting capacity to emerge as a global manufacturing force, Lalbhai said. “In the long term, it is good for everybody that India develops its own garmenting capacity. We have to take market share from all our neighbours. We have been punching below our weight as an industry in garments, and we have to grow aggressively,” he said.\nThe implementation of free trade agreements with the UK and the European Union could accelerate this shift, he added. “With the EU, it is a really big deal for our industry. All our competition has had duty-free access to these geographies. Now, suddenly, we will be on a level playing field with them,” Lalbhai said.\n“All countries, all customers are worried about overdependence on Bangladesh,” he said. “India suddenly starts looking much more attractive.” Arvind has already begun reallocating internal resources to capture these opportunities. “We are having conversations with customers, and we are reallocating a lot of internal marketing and sales resources to focus on these geographies so that we can build the pipeline before the implementation of the duty-free tariff,” Lalbhai said.\nDuty-free access to the UK and EU would also help rebalance Arvind’s geographic exposure. “That will go a long way in de-risking some of our US dependency,” he said.\nOn capital allocation, Lalbhai said garmenting remains the priority. “If I have $1 to invest, I will invest it in garmenting because garmenting is easier to sell and customers increasingly want a vertical offering rather than just fabric. Nobody buys fabric in the EU and the UK — they only buy full-package garments,” he said.\nPublished on  February 10, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

        "full_content": "Shares of one of India’s leading steel manufacturers, Tata Steel , rose as much as 4.5% to their day’s high of Rs 911 on the BSE on Tuesday, extending gains for a second session in a row following the company’s third quarter earnings. The stock is up over 7% during the same period. Consolidated net profit attributable to owners of the company jumped 723% YoY to Rs 2,689 crore from Rs 327 crore a year ago. Revenue from operations rose 6% YoY to Rs 57,002 crore in Q3FY26 compared with Rs 53,648 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. On a sequential basis, however, profit after tax declined 13% from Rs 3,102 crore in Q2FY26, while revenue fell 3% from Rs 58,689 crore in the July–September quarter. EBITDA stood at Rs 8,309 crore, up 39% YoY, with margins around 15%. In India, revenue came in at Rs 35,725 crore and EBITDA at Rs 8,291 crore, translating into a margin of 23%. Crude steel production in India increased 12% YoY to 6.34 million tons, while deliveries rose 14% YoY to a record 6.04 million tons — the company’s highest-ever quarterly deliveries. Should you buy, sell or hold? Live Events Axis Securities has maintained a Buy call and a target price of Rs 220 and expects an improvement in spreads during Q4FY26. In India, spreads are likely to expand as a Rs 3,500 per tonne recovery in HRC spot prices could lift blended NSRs by around Rs 2,300 per tonne QoQ, factoring in product mix and contracts. Although coking coal costs are projected to rise by about $15 per tonne, the impact is expected to be largely offset by sequential volume growth and a better product mix, supporting an EBITDA recovery in Q4FY26. Nomura has maintained a Buy rating on Tata Steel and set a target price of Rs 220, citing expectations of margin expansion in Q4FY26 driven by stronger HRC pricing. The brokerage expects domestic blended realisations per tonne to improve by about 4% QoQ, or roughly Rs 2,300 per tonne. On the cost front, rising coking coal prices are likely to weigh on domestic operations, with management guiding for a $15 per tonne increase. Consolidated volumes are projected to rise 10% YoY to around 9.2 MT in Q4FY26F, leading to an estimated sequential increase of about Rs 400 per tonne in consolidated EBITDA to roughly Rs 10,400 per tonne. The brokerage noted that Tata Steel has delivered resilient performance even when HRC prices were near cyclical lows. While FY27F and FY28F consolidated volume forecasts remain unchanged, EBITDA estimates have been increased by 4% on improved pricing assumptions. Nomura’s EBITDA per tonne projections for FY27F and FY28F are 5% and 3% above consensus, respectively. The target price is based on a one-year forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.0x, unchanged, while the stock currently trades at around 8.1x. Elara Capital has reiterated its Accumulate rating on Tata Steel and raised its target price to Rs 215 from Rs 187, citing the recent uptick in steel prices since mid-December and the imposition of safeguard duties on imports, which are expected to support near-term earnings growth. The brokerage has increased its EBITDA estimates for FY26 by 2% while maintaining projections for FY27 and FY28E. Elara noted that the anticipated reduction in funding overhang from domestic operations toward EU businesses has led it to revise the valuation multiple for domestic operations to 6.5x EV/EBITDA from 6.0x earlier, while retaining a 5.0x multiple for other businesses.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday adjourned to February 18 the hearing on a plea moved by the ED alleging obstruction by the West Bengal government, including by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in its search operation at the I-PAC office and the premises of its director in connection with an alleged coal pilferage scam.A bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Sandeep Mehta deferred the matter after it was informed that senior advocate Kapil Sibal was unwell.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta agreed to the adjournment.The top court on January 15 said the West Bengal chief minister’s alleged \"obstruction\" in ED’s probe is \"very serious\" and agreed to examine if a state’s law-enforcing agencies can interfere with any central agency’s probe into any serious offence as it stayed FIRs against the agency’s officials who raided political consultancy I-PAC on January 8.The top court, while staying the FIRs filed in West Bengal against ED officials, also directed the state police to protect the CCTV footage of the raids.It had issued notices to Banerjee, the West Bengal government, DGP Rajeev Kumar and top cops on the ED’s petitions seeking a CBI probe against them for allegedly obstructing raids at I-PAC premises.The ED has also alleged that Banerjee entered the raid sites and took away ”key” evidence, including physical documents and electronic devices, from the premises of I-PAC and obstructed and interfered with the investigation in the case.The ED has further claimed in its plea that the chief minister’s presence at the search site and the alleged removal of documents had an intimidating effect on officers and seriously compromised the federal probe agency’s ability to discharge its statutory functions independently.The ED’s plea in the apex court follows events from January 8, when the agency conducted searches on the premises of I-PAC and its director Pratik Jain in Kolkata as part of a money-laundering probe into the alleged multi-crore-rupee coal-pilferage scam.During the search operation, Banerjee reached the I-PAC office along with senior TMC leaders, confronted the ED officials and allegedly took away documents from the premises. The chief minister has accused the central agency of overreach.The West Bengal Police has also registered an FIR against ED officers.The TMC has denied the ED’s allegation of obstruction.It has further alleged that the ED action against I-PAC, the election consultant of the party, was aimed at accessing confidential election-strategy material.The party has maintained that I-PAC functions as its election strategist and that the ED’s action was intended to disrupt its electoral preparations rather than pursuing any bona fide investigation in the case.Assembly polls are due in West Bengal in a few months.",

So, there is much more to come.”Putting recent earnings performance into perspective, Chandan highlighted the sharp outperformance of small caps but cautioned on sustainability, saying, “This quarter, the small caps have delivered much better earnings growth… So large caps have so far given about 12% kind of profit growth. However, you should also look at the basis of how they were last year.”Outlining why the broader business environment in India is improving, he said, “Overall, we are in a better position compared to the last 12 months, because we are seeing the pickup on the consumption side. The cost of capital has come down over the last 12 months, and that is also helping businesses… if your cost of capital is coming down, your domestic market is picking up, and you have prospects in the export market, I think there isa  lot to play with.”Also Read: Global markets are fragile; be cautious with fresh investments, warns Richard HarrisOn whether the sharp earnings growth in small caps can continue, Chandan said sentiment is improving, but growth will normalise, adding, “The sentiment is getting better… from whatever interactions we've had with companies, sentiment is getting better… I don't think this 30% kind of growth can continue, but there is a lot to play within this small cap space now, where quality businesses are seeing some revival in growth and valuations are attractive because the entire category went through a correction in the last few months.”Explaining where his fund is finding opportunities, Chandan said, “We've seen selectively now within different pockets… materials, we are seeing good amount of action in cement, metals and even some of the chemicals companies… within consumer discretionary, now, we are seeing an improvement in demand… within industrial… capital goods, even within power, we are seeing many companies giving good numbers… except for maybe the IT sector, which is again, a top down kind of a negative view that we have.”Detailing how he is positioned for the economic upcycle, he said, “If you see in our portfolio, what we have done is we have added cement across the space… whether it is large cap… and then there are a couple of good mid cap companies… and a couple of small caps there… Metals, again, for ferrous and nonferrous, there are clear leaders in the space, and we go with the largest companies in this area… We have added more weightage among BFSI to private banks… So these three sectors, if you see industrials, materials and financials, these are the sectors you play with the up move or the economic upcycle.”Also Read: HDFC Life, SBI Life and Max Financial now on similar footing, Bernstein cautious on PB FintechOn the information technology sector, Chandan said weak sentiment is likely to persist, even though a sharp fall is unlikely, stating, “If sentimental negative will carry for some time… every few months probably you will see… because every company is working towards productivity gains… I think this hangover will continue for some time, and it will weigh on the valuations… But the cash flows, the return on capital ratios, the dividend payments or even buybacks… may not lead to a severe fall in the IT sector.",

If I look at quarter three numbers at a consolidated level, we grew revenue by about 27%, with EBITDA growing by 29% but ex-residential, which is a one-off we normally see our business ex-residential, and that's also grown 23% on revenue and 24% on EBITDA, quarter-on-quarter.The other good thing is, on a nine-month consolidated basis, we have grown 24% on revenue to about ₹15,103 odd crores, and about ₹677, crores at EBITDA level, for 28% year-on-year growth. Would that be a fair estimate?A: It's interesting you say that because that if you see pan India numbers for the calendar year, and not talking financial year, because most operators report calendar year numbers, we have come in at about 67% occupancy so far pan India at about ₹8,800 average daily rate , and that brings the revenue per available room  to say ₹5,500 and that growth has been quite steady and very encouraging. Some of the stuff that came through this time is also very heartening, because the approach of the government, clearly, is to improve the overall tourism infrastructure, and not just focus on one part of tourism, and that's one of the things that has been lacking in the country.The experience of tourists who have to be seen holistically and not just one segment of their holiday, so it's great that the government is looking at it that way. So, as a company, we have not moved away from third party operations, Athiva is one of the offerings, and yes, we will favour it, but we will continue to assess it in a dispassionate manner.Finally, just to finish up on debt, our debt remains at about ₹2,000 odd crores that has not moved dramatically from the last time we spoke, and we are very comfortable, sort of placed, both from an internal accrual perspective and headroom to take more debt to sort of fund all our future expansions and acquisitions as they come.Live stock market updates—follow our blog",

So excellent growth overall.Quarter four is also looking decent. January has been tough overall for us, but February is coming in strong, and March is coming in steady. So whilst we don't expect as strong quarter, but we do expect a quarter four also that comes in strong, and then that will bring the overall result for this year to be very good. The macros of the economy stay strong. It's broadly in favour of the industry. The demand supply arbitrage also stays, so we expect the not just the next year, next two to three years to be quite strong as well.Q: So two to three years, fair to assume that there would be about six to 8% increase in occupancy and a near double-digit sort of ADR growth. Would that be a fair estimate?A: It's interesting you say that because that if you see pan India numbers for the calendar year, and not talking financial year, because most operators report calendar year numbers, we have come in at about 67% occupancy so far pan India at about ₹8,800 average daily rate , and that brings the revenue per available room  to say ₹5,500 and that growth has been quite steady and very encouraging. And that's been the case for the last three to four years.There's no reason that we shouldn't expect a good RevPAR growth upwards and in double digits for the for the coming few years. How it will pan out between occupancy and ADR remains to be seen. But I suspect that the ADR will grow stronger than occupancy.Q: The Budget announcements that came by, the finance minister spoke about developing multiple tourism centers, etc. fell short on specific details, but the last two budgets, if you notice, the word tourism, or developing tourism, or the orange economy, has been spoken about a fair bit, they fell also short of announcing a blanket infrastructure status for the hotel industry. But be that, as it may have, you seen any formidable improvement from the government side when it comes to operating?A: It's very heartening to note that travel and tourism is finally getting its due. And the fact that, it has always been a great contributor to the GDP overall, as well as to the employment percentage. It is high time that it is written recognised as one of the key industries that contribute to the overall growth of the of the country. From that perspective, it's all been good. Some of the stuff that came through this time is also very heartening, because the approach of the government, clearly, is to improve the overall tourism infrastructure, and not just focus on one part of tourism, and that's one of the things that has been lacking in the country.The experience of tourists who have to be seen holistically and not just one segment of their holiday, so it's great that the government is looking at it that way. It is sad indeed, that our request of granting a blanket infrastructure status has not been met once more, but I am sure that with the prominence that tourism is gaining in the conversations of the government, we will be there soon. I still have that hope.Q: Now that you have decided upon this entire bouquet of Athiva properties, what is the outlook here? What do you expect in terms of business contribution coming in from this business, and also an updated number on your debt? It was a little over ₹2,000 crores that I last saw. Where is that number standard and the repayment plan so on, Athiva and debt, if you could give us some colour?A: ATHIVA, is a point of pride for us and what we have done with what was erstwhile the Dukes and is now called the Athiva Khandala is absolutely brilliant. Even a blade of grass is not the from the old hotel. We have invested over ₹170 crores in that property. And not just the product, even the service that has come out have seen absolutely fantastic reviews. So, that particular hotel is well on its way to sort of dominate the market in that particular micro market, and we are very comfortable that we will continue to do so.Our Athiva plans, as you are aware, and we have made that announcement, at this point, is to put a name across our own properties. So, we have announced 900 keys under this, including the Athiva Khandala. And it's not different from the announced pipeline. It's from within the pipeline that we will be brand agnostically assessing which hotel will fit the Athiva brand and therefore, even though it's our property, we will give it a full run against all the other brands that are available. So, as a company, we have not moved away from third party operations, Athiva is one of the offerings, and yes, we will favour it, but we will continue to assess it in a dispassionate manner.Finally, just to finish up on debt, our debt remains at about ₹2,000 odd crores that has not moved dramatically from the last time we spoke, and we are very comfortable, sort of placed, both from an internal accrual perspective and headroom to take more debt to sort of fund all our future expansions and acquisitions as they come.Live stock market updates—follow our blog",

As a result, EBITDA margin narrowed to 7.8% from 8.7% YoY, reflecting elevated operating expenses and limited operating leverage.On the cost front, total expenses for the quarter stood at ₹720.2 crore, broadly in line with last year. Cost of materials consumed was ₹574.7 crore, while purchases of stock-in-trade came in at ₹96.9 crore. Inventory movement remained favourable, with a reduction of ₹15.9 crore during the quarter.Employee benefit expenses were ₹9.1 crore, finance costs stood at ₹2.4 crore, and depreciation and amortisation expense was ₹3.4 crore. Other expenses for the quarter were ₹49.7 crore.Overall, the quarter reflected stable topline growth but pressure on margins, as higher costs offset revenue gains, keeping profitability under check despite healthy operational activity.Panama Petrochem Ltd  is an Indian specialty‑petrochemical manufacturer that makes and sells chemicals derived from crude‑oil/ base‑oil feedstock to industrial customers. The company runs plants in India and the UAE and exports to the Middle East, Africa, and other regions.For the nine months ended December, Panama Petrochem’s revenue from operations grew 6.9% YoY to ₹2,241.5 crore, compared with ₹2,097.7 crore a year ago.

        "full_content": "Global private equity major Carlyle will acquire a strategic majority stake in Nido Home Finance, the housing finance arm of Edelweiss Financial Services, through an investment of Rs 2,100 crore, marking one of the largest deals in India’s affordable housing finance space in recent years.\nUnder the transaction, investment funds affiliated with Carlyle Asia Partners will pick up a 45% stake in Nido from Edelweiss through a secondary purchase and simultaneously infuse fresh primary capital of ₹1,500 crore into the company. The deal will result in Carlyle becoming the majority shareholder, while Edelweiss will continue to retain a significant minority stake in the housing finance business.\nFounded in 2010, Nido Home Finance is among India’s leading housing finance companies focused on the affordable and mass-market segments. The company has a wide national footprint, operating across more than 800 talukas, with a strong presence in rural and semi-urban markets. As of now, Nido manages assets under management (AUM) of about ₹4,804 crore and has built a franchise centred on first-time home buyers and self-employed borrowers who remain underpenetrated by traditional lenders.\nThe transaction is aimed at strengthening Nido’s balance sheet and accelerating its next phase of growth at a time when India’s housing finance sector is witnessing strong structural demand. Rising affordability, sustained policy support for housing, and the deepening of formal credit in smaller towns have created a long-term growth runway for lenders focused on the affordable segment.\nFor Edelweiss, the partnership with Carlyle aligns with its stated strategy of unlocking value in its businesses while bringing in long-term strategic partners. The capital infusion is expected to support faster loan book expansion, technology investments, and deeper penetration in underserved geographies.\n“This investment is a key milestone for Nido and brings in a high-quality, long-term partner to accelerate its growth journey,” Edelweiss Chairman and Managing Director Rashesh Shah said. He added that Nido is well positioned to benefit from the strong demand environment in housing finance, supported by improving access to formal credit and rising home ownership aspirations.\nCarlyle, which has been investing in India for over two decades, said the deal reflects its conviction in the country’s housing finance opportunity. The global investment firm has prior experience in the segment through investments in companies such as PNB Housing Finance and HDFC. As part of the transaction, Aditya Puri, senior advisor to Carlyle in Asia and former CEO of HDFC Bank, will also participate as an investor, underscoring the strategic importance of the partnership.\n“We are excited to partner with Edelweiss to support Nido’s expansion, particularly in rural and semi-urban markets where housing remains a critical national priority,” said Sunil Kaul, Partner and Asia Financial Services Sector Lead at Carlyle. He noted that Carlyle would leverage its operational expertise to help strengthen governance and risk management frameworks at Nido to ensure sustainable long-term growth.\nThe transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from the Reserve Bank of India, National Housing Bank, Competition Commission of India and other customary conditions. Once completed, the deal is expected to further intensify competition in India’s affordable housing finance space, as well-capitalised lenders vie to tap the next wave of home ownership growth.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

Debt as on December 31 stood at ₹24,852 crore, followed by reduction of another ₹2,000 crore in January 2026. This disciplined deleveraging has lowered finance costs and created headroom for growth investments. “Operational efficiency, inventory liquidation, cost optimisation and strong treasury management, all add up to better financial prudence,” Panda said.\nMeanwhile, according to the company, during the nine-month period (Apr–Dec) of FY26, sales volumes surged by 16.3 per cent, driven by proactive marketing initiatives and deeper engagement with retail and new customer segments. This push took total sales to 16.6 million tonnes between April 2025 and January 2026, while also enabling significant inventory liquidation. “By reducing both in-process and finished steel stocks, SAIL freed up cash flows and lowered working capital requirements, strengthening its financial position,” it said.\nOperational levers are also being sharpened to reduce cost. Annual manpower reduction is steadily improving per-tonne employee cost efficiency. At the same time, SAIL is sourcing more renewable power, both as a compliance requirement as well as a cost-advantage lever, creating structural savings in energy expenditure. “These measures align with the company’s broader sustainability agenda while reinforcing competitiveness,” the company said.\nEarlier, the company reported a net profit of ₹374 crore for the October-December quarter, up from ₹142 crore in the year-ago period. The growth in profit, roughly 2.6-fold on-year, was driven by operational efficiency, inventory liquidation, and cost optimisation measures, the company said. Revenue for the quarter rose 12 per cent on-year to ₹27,371 crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 13 per cent to ₹2,294 crore from 8.3 per cent a year ago.\nPublished on  February 10, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

So, some amount of profit booking or correction was expected. These companies operate in a competitive global market. Competitive pressures will always be there and they have to be cognizant of that.\"\nBandyopadhyay also flagged the need for caution, particularly on developments related to the US. \"Some amount of caution is again required as the US is engaged with multiple countries, and we know with this current US administration, things change overnight.\"\nHe added, \"Valuation correction was warranted because the stocks ran up too fast. That's pretty much what is happening. I would say that with EU and UK trade deals in place, I don't think much is going to change there. But as far as the US trade deal is concerned, things may remain fluid. We have to be prepared for volatility and I'm sure the companies are tackling that,\" Bandyopadhyay said.\nSharing his approach towards export-oriented sectors, the market expert stressed the importance of timing and patience. \"The only trick is to pick the stocks, you know, not at the top level, which is what happened in the consecutive days. You have to let these stocks correct a bit, then you have to pick the stocks.\"\nHe also said, \"I think there is absolutely no doubt that there is a significant opportunity for these companies to scale up their exports and their business, which will be good for these companies as well as the economy in terms of employment and multiple other vectors. But having said that, I would also say that you have to remember that this volatility is going to remain and you have to be prepared for volatility.\"\nBandyopadhyay further underscored the need for a longer investment horizon. \"Let us say you pick up a Gokaldas Exports, Welspun or Indo Count, then wait for that little bit of correction and then pick up the stocks. Be prepared for volatility and be prepared to remain invested for a few years. If that is the matrix under which you are operating, I am sure you will make a lot of money.\"\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today.

The company's consolidated revenue from operations for the quarter stood at Rs 25,416 crore, a jump of 43 per cent against Rs 17,740 crore reported in the same period last fiscal.

It posted an increase in consolidated profit after tax by 61% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to ₹1,684 crore for the third quarter of FY26.\nHeidelbergCement India reported net profit for the quarter ended December 2025 at Rs 15.6 crore compared to Rs 5.2 crore in the same quarter last year.\nShares traded at Rs 170.25 on the NSE, down 1%.\nEdelweiss Financial Services Ltd Q3FY26 Concall Highlights\nMcap- Rs11,500 Cr\nCMP- Rs- 121\nGroup Financial Performance (Q3 FY26 and 9MFY26)\nThe group reported steady improvement in profitability and scale. For nine months ended December 2025, consolidated PAT was Rs 549 Cr, up 45% YoY, while post-minority PAT was Rs 459 Cr, up 56% YoY. Consolidated revenue for 9MFY26 stood at Rs 8,896 Cr. For Q3FY26, consolidated PAT was Rs 270 Cr and revenue was Rs 4,715 Cr, supported by strong performance in asset management, insurance and credit businesses. Underlying businesses continued to show stable growth, while consolidated numbers also reflected stake sale gains and certain exceptional items.\nBusiness Model and P&L Structure\nManagement explained that Edelweiss’ consolidated P&L has two parts: operating businesses and the corporate/holding company. Operating businesses generate steady, growing profits and are independently managed with their own boards and capital. The corporate entity undertakes capital allocation, treasury support and incubation of new businesses, but its P&L is more volatile due to interest costs, dividends, capital gains and stake sales. The focus remains on growing business PAT at ~20% annually and reducing corporate debt, which has been taken earlier to support subsidiaries.\nAlternative Asset Management (EAAA)\nThe alternatives platform remains a key growth engine. Fee-paying AUM grew 33% YoY to about Rs 41,920 Cr. Fundraising momentum is strong with ~Rs 7,500+ Cr raised in nine months, and management expects to sustain ~20%+ AUM growth. The platform is multi-strategy across private credit and real assets. Real assets now form a larger share with focus on operating assets in roads, energy, renewables and commercial real estate. New funds such as Performing Credit Fund IV and sector InvITs in energy and transportation are seeing traction. EAAA’s DRHP has been filed, and listing is targeted within the usual 4–6 month IPO timeline, primarily to create visibility, unlock value and support corporate deleveraging.\nMutual Fund Business\nThe mutual fund business showed strong traction with equity AUM up 33% YoY to ~Rs 83,000 Cr and total AUM growth of ~18% YoY. SIP book crossed Rs 500 Cr monthly, up ~55% YoY, and retail folios reached ~34 lakh. Growth is driven by branch expansion, deeper distributor engagement, product innovation and consistent performance rather than star-manager concentration. Tier 2 and 3 cities are key growth areas. Profitability is improving alongside AUM scale.\nAsset Reconstruction (ARC)\nARC continues to focus on recoveries from legacy assets, with Rs 842 Cr recovered in the quarter. Retail assets now form ~25% of capital deployed versus ~15% a year ago, showing diversification beyond large corporate NPAs. The business is currently in a recovery cycle for the industry, with slower new acquisitions due to lower system NPAs. The ARC entity is over-capitalized, and excess capital is being returned via dividends to improve ROE and support group deleveraging.\nNBFC and MSME Lending\nThe MSME business has restarted growth after balance sheet clean-up. Disbursements rose sharply, with monthly run-rate moving from ~Rs 25–30 Cr earlier to ~Rs 100+ Cr now. Growth is supported by a new leadership team, technology investments, new products and branch additions. Asset quality metrics remain controlled, and the wholesale book has been reduced significantly YoY.\nEicher Motors delivered strong Q3 FY26 results with 22.94% YoY revenue growth and a notable 96 bps sequential improvement in consolidated EBITDA margin to 25.46%. The VECV joint venture also contributed significantly with 35.60% QoQ profit growth, highlighting effective operational management and leverage.\nTop gainers of Nifty 50:\nEicher Motors (+6.27%), Apollo Hospitals (+5.15%), Max Health (+2.21%), TMPV (+1.36%), M&M (+1.32%)\nTop losers:\nONGC (-1.80%), Coal India (-1.58%), Hindalco (-1.32%), Eternal (-0.74%), Grasim (-0.68%)\nSensex rose by 131.72 pts or 0.16% to 84,405.64 at 9.21 am after opening at 84,339.15against the previous close of 84,273.92.

At 9.46 am, it traded at Rs 4,324 on the NSE. It posted an increase in consolidated profit after tax by 61% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to ₹1,684 crore for the third quarter of FY26.\nHeidelbergCement India reported net profit for the quarter ended December 2025 at Rs 15.6 crore compared to Rs 5.2 crore in the same quarter last year.\nShares traded at Rs 170.25 on the NSE, down 1%.\nEdelweiss Financial Services Ltd Q3FY26 Concall Highlights\nMcap- Rs11,500 Cr\nCMP- Rs- 121\nGroup Financial Performance (Q3 FY26 and 9MFY26)\nThe group reported steady improvement in profitability and scale. For nine months ended December 2025, consolidated PAT was Rs 549 Cr, up 45% YoY, while post-minority PAT was Rs 459 Cr, up 56% YoY. Consolidated revenue for 9MFY26 stood at Rs 8,896 Cr. For Q3FY26, consolidated PAT was Rs 270 Cr and revenue was Rs 4,715 Cr, supported by strong performance in asset management, insurance and credit businesses. Underlying businesses continued to show stable growth, while consolidated numbers also reflected stake sale gains and certain exceptional items.\nBusiness Model and P&L Structure\nManagement explained that Edelweiss’ consolidated P&L has two parts: operating businesses and the corporate/holding company. Operating businesses generate steady, growing profits and are independently managed with their own boards and capital. The corporate entity undertakes capital allocation, treasury support and incubation of new businesses, but its P&L is more volatile due to interest costs, dividends, capital gains and stake sales. The focus remains on growing business PAT at ~20% annually and reducing corporate debt, which has been taken earlier to support subsidiaries.\nAlternative Asset Management (EAAA)\nThe alternatives platform remains a key growth engine. Fee-paying AUM grew 33% YoY to about Rs 41,920 Cr. Fundraising momentum is strong with ~Rs 7,500+ Cr raised in nine months, and management expects to sustain ~20%+ AUM growth. The platform is multi-strategy across private credit and real assets. Real assets now form a larger share with focus on operating assets in roads, energy, renewables and commercial real estate. New funds such as Performing Credit Fund IV and sector InvITs in energy and transportation are seeing traction. EAAA’s DRHP has been filed, and listing is targeted within the usual 4–6 month IPO timeline, primarily to create visibility, unlock value and support corporate deleveraging.\nMutual Fund Business\nThe mutual fund business showed strong traction with equity AUM up 33% YoY to ~Rs 83,000 Cr and total AUM growth of ~18% YoY. SIP book crossed Rs 500 Cr monthly, up ~55% YoY, and retail folios reached ~34 lakh. Growth is driven by branch expansion, deeper distributor engagement, product innovation and consistent performance rather than star-manager concentration. Tier 2 and 3 cities are key growth areas. Profitability is improving alongside AUM scale.\nAsset Reconstruction (ARC)\nARC continues to focus on recoveries from legacy assets, with Rs 842 Cr recovered in the quarter. Retail assets now form ~25% of capital deployed versus ~15% a year ago, showing diversification beyond large corporate NPAs. The business is currently in a recovery cycle for the industry, with slower new acquisitions due to lower system NPAs. The ARC entity is over-capitalized, and excess capital is being returned via dividends to improve ROE and support group deleveraging.\nNBFC and MSME Lending\nThe MSME business has restarted growth after balance sheet clean-up. Disbursements rose sharply, with monthly run-rate moving from ~Rs 25–30 Cr earlier to ~Rs 100+ Cr now. Growth is supported by a new leadership team, technology investments, new products and branch additions. Asset quality metrics remain controlled, and the wholesale book has been reduced significantly YoY.\nEicher Motors delivered strong Q3 FY26 results with 22.94% YoY revenue growth and a notable 96 bps sequential improvement in consolidated EBITDA margin to 25.46%. The VECV joint venture also contributed significantly with 35.60% QoQ profit growth, highlighting effective operational management and leverage.\nTop gainers of Nifty 50:\nEicher Motors (+6.27%), Apollo Hospitals (+5.15%), Max Health (+2.21%), TMPV (+1.36%), M&M (+1.32%)\nTop losers:\nONGC (-1.80%), Coal India (-1.58%), Hindalco (-1.32%), Eternal (-0.74%), Grasim (-0.68%)\nSensex rose by 131.72 pts or 0.16% to 84,405.64 at 9.21 am after opening at 84,339.15against the previous close of 84,273.92.

Profitability is improving alongside AUM scale.\nAsset Reconstruction (ARC)\nARC continues to focus on recoveries from legacy assets, with Rs 842 Cr recovered in the quarter. Retail assets now form ~25% of capital deployed versus ~15% a year ago, showing diversification beyond large corporate NPAs. The business is currently in a recovery cycle for the industry, with slower new acquisitions due to lower system NPAs. The ARC entity is over-capitalized, and excess capital is being returned via dividends to improve ROE and support group deleveraging.\nNBFC and MSME Lending\nThe MSME business has restarted growth after balance sheet clean-up. Disbursements rose sharply, with monthly run-rate moving from ~Rs 25–30 Cr earlier to ~Rs 100+ Cr now. Growth is supported by a new leadership team, technology investments, new products and branch additions. Asset quality metrics remain controlled, and the wholesale book has been reduced significantly YoY.\nEicher Motors delivered strong Q3 FY26 results with 22.94% YoY revenue growth and a notable 96 bps sequential improvement in consolidated EBITDA margin to 25.46%. The VECV joint venture also contributed significantly with 35.60% QoQ profit growth, highlighting effective operational management and leverage.\nTop gainers of Nifty 50:\nEicher Motors (+6.27%), Apollo Hospitals (+5.15%), Max Health (+2.21%), TMPV (+1.36%), M&M (+1.32%)\nTop losers:\nONGC (-1.80%), Coal India (-1.58%), Hindalco (-1.32%), Eternal (-0.74%), Grasim (-0.68%)\nSensex rose by 131.72 pts or 0.16% to 84,405.64 at 9.21 am after opening at 84,339.15against the previous close of 84,273.92.

At 9.46 am, it traded at Rs 4,324 on the NSE. It posted an increase in consolidated profit after tax by 61% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to ₹1,684 crore for the third quarter of FY26.\nHeidelbergCement India reported net profit for the quarter ended December 2025 at Rs 15.6 crore compared to Rs 5.2 crore in the same quarter last year.\nShares traded at Rs 170.25 on the NSE, down 1%.\nEdelweiss Financial Services Ltd Q3FY26 Concall Highlights\nMcap- Rs11,500 Cr\nCMP- Rs- 121\nGroup Financial Performance (Q3 FY26 and 9MFY26)\nThe group reported steady improvement in profitability and scale. For nine months ended December 2025, consolidated PAT was Rs 549 Cr, up 45% YoY, while post-minority PAT was Rs 459 Cr, up 56% YoY. Consolidated revenue for 9MFY26 stood at Rs 8,896 Cr. For Q3FY26, consolidated PAT was Rs 270 Cr and revenue was Rs 4,715 Cr, supported by strong performance in asset management, insurance and credit businesses. Underlying businesses continued to show stable growth, while consolidated numbers also reflected stake sale gains and certain exceptional items.\nBusiness Model and P&L Structure\nManagement explained that Edelweiss’ consolidated P&L has two parts: operating businesses and the corporate/holding company. Operating businesses generate steady, growing profits and are independently managed with their own boards and capital. The corporate entity undertakes capital allocation, treasury support and incubation of new businesses, but its P&L is more volatile due to interest costs, dividends, capital gains and stake sales. The focus remains on growing business PAT at ~20% annually and reducing corporate debt, which has been taken earlier to support subsidiaries.\nAlternative Asset Management (EAAA)\nThe alternatives platform remains a key growth engine. Fee-paying AUM grew 33% YoY to about Rs 41,920 Cr. Fundraising momentum is strong with ~Rs 7,500+ Cr raised in nine months, and management expects to sustain ~20%+ AUM growth. The platform is multi-strategy across private credit and real assets. Real assets now form a larger share with focus on operating assets in roads, energy, renewables and commercial real estate. New funds such as Performing Credit Fund IV and sector InvITs in energy and transportation are seeing traction. EAAA’s DRHP has been filed, and listing is targeted within the usual 4–6 month IPO timeline, primarily to create visibility, unlock value and support corporate deleveraging.\nMutual Fund Business\nThe mutual fund business showed strong traction with equity AUM up 33% YoY to ~Rs 83,000 Cr and total AUM growth of ~18% YoY. SIP book crossed Rs 500 Cr monthly, up ~55% YoY, and retail folios reached ~34 lakh.
