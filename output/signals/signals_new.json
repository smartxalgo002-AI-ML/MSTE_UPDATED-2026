Garg said the company had guided for about ₹10,000 crore of order inflows this year and expects conversion of the Pune-Shirur project to support the pipeline.

Its shares have declined more than 19% over the last one year.The company said it remains confident about future profitability and order pipeline, supported by project conversion and execution in the coming financial year.These are edited excerpts of the interview.Q: You had cut the guidance from ₹4,000 crore to about ₹3,600–3,700 crore. How confident are you about that? And if you could give us a sense of order activity — whether order wins this year could exceed your guidance.A: Yes, we had given guidance that we would achieve turnover of ₹4,000 crore at the consolidated level for FY26. Because of certain uncontrollable events like an extended monsoon, delays in the award of one of our major projects, and some statutory clearances, I don't think we will be able to hit the revenue guidance.But the positive side is that our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation  are very strong. Whatever guidance that we had given at the start of the year, we are likely to meet or exceed that EBITDA guidance on an annualised basis.I think the deferment of revenue from FY26 to FY27 is something which is like business, rather than anything which has to do with the fundamentals of the company. The company fundamentally remains strong, both in terms of profitability and on the order book.We had guided about ₹10,000 crore of orders we will book in this year, which, if we can convert in the next 50 days, which we are reasonably confident — that the Pune-Shirur scheduled project, where we have opened L1, will get converted into an order — we would have met the guidance, and we see a lot of traction going forward on orders.On an overall basis, I am very confident about the company's future and also about the profitability of the company.Q: So, with the Pune-Shirur project, you're saying execution will begin in this quarter itself, Q4? Is that the guidance, or will it spill into the next financial year? If you could give us a timeline, and therefore, what would the guidance for the full-year revenue be? What is the visibility you have right now, given that you've already cut your guidance for this year?A: The Pune-Shirur is a BOT project. If it gets awarded in the next 45 days, the revenue recognition for the project will start only after about five to six months.Also Read | Sugar prices must rise further to offset input costs, says Triveni EngineeringThe revenue recognition will be in the latter half of FY27, which is what we currently forecast.In terms of our guidance, will we be able to meet the revenue? Will the revenue for FY27 grow? The answer is yes. We are reasonably confident that the revenue of FY27 will grow, because a couple of orders that we are now booking will start contributing in the first half of FY27.Q: What kind of order inflow will you end this year with? You had earlier given a target of ₹10,000 crore, with the possibility of you outdoing that.A: We do believe that we will be able to meet ₹10,000 crore for sure at the consolidated level. We may be slightly able to exceed that as well, depending upon the timing of the awards.However, we are reasonably confident that we should be closing the order book for FY26 at an unexecuted order book of about ₹20,000 crore at a consolidated level.Q: On the Jal Jeevan Mission, regarding receivable stress, in the last quarter, you told us there was some kind of payment delay — about ₹200 to ₹220 crore of receivables was what you had flagged. Given the high exposure that you have to water projects and the sharp drop in revenue from the segment in the quarter, could you give us a sense of how the situation has panned out since then? Are you seeing an improvement here?A: Yes, we see some improvement there. The state has started releasing funds. We did receive some funds in the month of January, and the important point is that in the Union Budget 2026 speech, there has been an allocation to the Jal Jeevan Mission, which we believe will get released before March.So, we expect the receivables from UP JJM projects to get realised. And we see that in FY27, there is a substantial allocation towards JJM projects.

        "full_content": "Subhrakant Panda, Managing Director, Indian Metals & Ferro Alloys Ltd (IMFA)\nIndian Metals & Ferro Alloys Ltd (IMFA) reported a profit after tax of ₹130.67 crore on revenues of ₹702.83 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, marking an 18.59 per cent profit margin. The Bhubaneswar-based ferro chrome producer’s EBITDA stood at ₹164.33 crore with a margin of 23.38 per cent.\nThe company is set to double its ferro chrome capacity through two initiatives. A greenfield expansion adding 100,000 tonnes per annum capacity at Kalinganagar is on schedule, with the first furnace expected to be commissioned in June 2026. Additionally, IMFA signed agreements in November 2025 to acquire Tata Steel’s ferro chrome plant at Kalinganagar for ₹610 crore, adding 150,000 tpa capacity. The acquisition is pending regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the current quarter.\nThese expansions will increase IMFA’s total production capacity from 284,000 tpa to 534,000 tpa, positioning it as India’s largest ferro chrome producer. The company produced 67,196 tonnes of ferro chrome in Q3 and sold 64,802 tonnes, with exports accounting for ₹603.15 crore of quarterly revenue.\nManaging Director Subhrakant Panda attributed the results to improved realisations and stable operating costs. He indicated plans to increase domestic market exposure as new capacity comes online, while benefiting from reduced production costs due to proximity to captive chrome ore mines at Sukinda and Mahagiri.\nThe shares of Indian Metals & Ferro Alloys Ltd ended on the NSE today at ₹1,326, up by ₹2.30 or 0.17 per cent.\nPublished on  February 5, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

        "full_content": "The report, titled ‘Transforming Indian healthcare, one specialty at a time’, said focused, single-speciality providers are emerging as the fastest-growing segment of India’s healthcare ecosystem.\nIndia’s single-speciality healthcare provider market is projected to nearly triple to $12.3 billion by 2030, from about $4.4 billion in 2025.\nThe market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 22 per cent, according to a new roadmap released by Bessemer Venture Partners on Thursday.\nThe report, titled ‘Transforming Indian healthcare, one specialty at a time’, said focused, single-speciality providers are emerging as the fastest-growing segment of India’s healthcare ecosystem. The segment is expanding at more than twice the pace of the broader provider market.\nBessemer noted that India’s $54-billion healthcare provider sector is undergoing a structural shift. While multi-speciality hospitals continue to play a critical role in complex care, a parallel ecosystem of specialised providers is scaling rapidly, driven by repeatable care protocols, concentrated clinical expertise and asset-light expansion models.\nThese platforms are purpose-built for scale, the report said, adding that speciality-native providers are increasingly preferred in high-volume, repeatable care segments such as eyecare, oncology and dental care.\nAccording to the roadmap, speciality-focused platforms are gaining ground due to superior patient experience, faster scalability and stronger unit economics. Learner, hub-and-spoke models allow standardised protocols and providers to expand quickly across tier-1 and tier-2 cities. Bessemer estimates payback periods of 12 to 18 months, with sustainable EBITDA margins of over 20 per cent.\nThe investment firm has backed this thesis through investments in companies such as NephroPlus, which operates dialysis centres across India and overseas markets including Nepal, the Philippines and Uzbekistan; Pluro, which focuses on IVF care; and Sukino, which provides continuum care services.\nThe report also highlighted a lack of nationally recognised brands across most speciality segments, creating a significant opportunity for founders to build category leaders. This, Bessemer said, can be achieved through a combination of operational rigour, superior patient outcomes and consolidation of regional clinic networks.\n“As this market races toward $12 billion, we expect the next generation of iconic Indian healthcare companies will be built one speciality at a time,” said Nithin Kaimal, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, India. The winners will be those platforms that combine deep clinical expertise with the ability to scale in a disciplined manner, expanding access and creating long-term value, he said.\nBessemer added that successful platforms could emerge as strong IPO candidates or acquisition targets for larger healthcare conglomerates over the coming years.\n(With inputs from businessline intern Tejaswini S)\nPublished on  February 5, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",
