The deal will result in Carlyle becoming the majority shareholder, while Edelweiss will continue to retain a significant minority stake in the housing finance business.\nFounded in 2010, Nido Home Finance is among India’s leading housing finance companies focused on the affordable and mass-market segments. The company has a wide national footprint, operating across more than 800 talukas, with a strong presence in rural and semi-urban markets. As of now, Nido manages assets under management (AUM) of about ₹4,804 crore and has built a franchise centred on first-time home buyers and self-employed borrowers who remain underpenetrated by traditional lenders.\nThe transaction is aimed at strengthening Nido’s balance sheet and accelerating its next phase of growth at a time when India’s housing finance sector is witnessing strong structural demand. Rising affordability, sustained policy support for housing, and the deepening of formal credit in smaller towns have created a long-term growth runway for lenders focused on the affordable segment.\nFor Edelweiss, the partnership with Carlyle aligns with its stated strategy of unlocking value in its businesses while bringing in long-term strategic partners. The capital infusion is expected to support faster loan book expansion, technology investments, and deeper penetration in underserved geographies.\n“This investment is a key milestone for Nido and brings in a high-quality, long-term partner to accelerate its growth journey,” Edelweiss Chairman and Managing Director Rashesh Shah said. He added that Nido is well positioned to benefit from the strong demand environment in housing finance, supported by improving access to formal credit and rising home ownership aspirations.\nCarlyle, which has been investing in India for over two decades, said the deal reflects its conviction in the country’s housing finance opportunity. The global investment firm has prior experience in the segment through investments in companies such as PNB Housing Finance and HDFC. As part of the transaction, Aditya Puri, senior advisor to Carlyle in Asia and former CEO of HDFC Bank, will also participate as an investor, underscoring the strategic importance of the partnership.\n“We are excited to partner with Edelweiss to support Nido’s expansion, particularly in rural and semi-urban markets where housing remains a critical national priority,” said Sunil Kaul, Partner and Asia Financial Services Sector Lead at Carlyle. He noted that Carlyle would leverage its operational expertise to help strengthen governance and risk management frameworks at Nido to ensure sustainable long-term growth.\nThe transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from the Reserve Bank of India, National Housing Bank, Competition Commission of India and other customary conditions. Once completed, the deal is expected to further intensify competition in India’s affordable housing finance space, as well-capitalised lenders vie to tap the next wave of home ownership growth.\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 13 per cent to ₹2,294 crore from 8.3 per cent a year ago.",
        "full_content": "‘By reducing debt, managing inventories more efficiently and expanding reach through focused marketing initiatives, SAIL is strengthening its foundations while preparing for expansion’\nSteel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) aims to close the fiscal year 2025-26 with sales of 20 million tonnes, nearly 12 per cent higher than 17.9 million tonnes achieved in FY25, a senior company official said.\n“By reducing debt, managing inventories more efficiently and expanding reach through focused marketing initiatives, SAIL is strengthening its foundations while preparing for expansion. With rising demand, a robust capex pipeline, and a clear commitment to sustainability and green steel, we are confident of achieving close to 20 million tonnes of sales in FY26 and even setting higher targets in the years ahead, turning today’s strength into tomorrow’s opportunity,” said AK Panda, Director (Finance), with additional charge as Director (Commercial) at SAIL.\nIn the earnings call, Panda noted that debt reduction has been substantial with ₹5,000 crore being repaid in the nine-month period (Apr-Dec) of the current fiscal. Debt as on December 31 stood at ₹24,852 crore, followed by reduction of another ₹2,000 crore in January 2026. This disciplined deleveraging has lowered finance costs and created headroom for growth investments. “Operational efficiency, inventory liquidation, cost optimisation and strong treasury management, all add up to better financial prudence,” Panda said.\nMeanwhile, according to the company, during the nine-month period (Apr–Dec) of FY26, sales volumes surged by 16.3 per cent, driven by proactive marketing initiatives and deeper engagement with retail and new customer segments. This push took total sales to 16.6 million tonnes between April 2025 and January 2026, while also enabling significant inventory liquidation. “By reducing both in-process and finished steel stocks, SAIL freed up cash flows and lowered working capital requirements, strengthening its financial position,” it said.\nOperational levers are also being sharpened to reduce cost. Annual manpower reduction is steadily improving per-tonne employee cost efficiency. At the same time, SAIL is sourcing more renewable power, both as a compliance requirement as well as a cost-advantage lever, creating structural savings in energy expenditure. “These measures align with the company’s broader sustainability agenda while reinforcing competitiveness,” the company said.\nEarlier, the company reported a net profit of ₹374 crore for the October-December quarter, up from ₹142 crore in the year-ago period. The growth in profit, roughly 2.6-fold on-year, was driven by operational efficiency, inventory liquidation, and cost optimisation measures, the company said. Revenue for the quarter rose 12 per cent on-year to ₹27,371 crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 13 per cent to ₹2,294 crore from 8.3 per cent a year ago.\nPublished on  February 10, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

A review of the data shows that ECB funds during the month were primarily utilised for import of capital goods, new project execution, modernisation of facilities, and on-lending by financial institutions. These borrowings are permitted under the Reserve Bank of India's automatic or approval routes and are typically used for capital expenditure, new projects, modernisation, refinancing and working capital needs.

The airline raised $1.55 billion and $1.20 billion, both with a maturity of 12 years, from leasing companies.\nThe entire borrowing was earmarked for the import of capital goods, indicating aircraft acquisition and fleet expansion as part of the Tata Group -owned carrier's ongoing transformation and modernisation programme.\nInterGlobe Aviation Limited , which operates IndiGo , also featured prominently among ECB borrowers. The airline raised a total of $4563.7 million across four separate borrowings, with maturities ranging between 10 and 12 years.\nAll the ECB tranches were utilised for the import of capital goods and were sourced from leasing companies, aligning with IndiGo's strategy of funding aircraft induction through long-term offshore financing.\nPublished on  February 10, 2026\nBACK TO TOP",

Competitive pressures will always be there and they have to be cognizant of that.\"\nBandyopadhyay also flagged the need for caution, particularly on developments related to the US. \"Some amount of caution is again required as the US is engaged with multiple countries, and we know with this current US administration, things change overnight.\"\nHe added, \"Valuation correction was warranted because the stocks ran up too fast. That's pretty much what is happening. I would say that with EU and UK trade deals in place, I don't think much is going to change there. But as far as the US trade deal is concerned, things may remain fluid. We have to be prepared for volatility and I'm sure the companies are tackling that,\" Bandyopadhyay said.\nSharing his approach towards export-oriented sectors, the market expert stressed the importance of timing and patience. \"The only trick is to pick the stocks, you know, not at the top level, which is what happened in the consecutive days. You have to let these stocks correct a bit, then you have to pick the stocks.\"\nHe also said, \"I think there is absolutely no doubt that there is a significant opportunity for these companies to scale up their exports and their business, which will be good for these companies as well as the economy in terms of employment and multiple other vectors. But having said that, I would also say that you have to remember that this volatility is going to remain and you have to be prepared for volatility.\"\nBandyopadhyay further underscored the need for a longer investment horizon. \"Let us say you pick up a Gokaldas Exports, Welspun or Indo Count, then wait for that little bit of correction and then pick up the stocks. Be prepared for volatility and be prepared to remain invested for a few years. If that is the matrix under which you are operating, I am sure you will make a lot of money.\"\nCopyright © 2026 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today.

At 9.46 am, it traded at Rs 4,324 on the NSE. It posted an increase in consolidated profit after tax by 61% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to ₹1,684 crore for the third quarter of FY26.\nHeidelbergCement India reported net profit for the quarter ended December 2025 at Rs 15.6 crore compared to Rs 5.2 crore in the same quarter last year.\nShares traded at Rs 170.25 on the NSE, down 1%.\nEdelweiss Financial Services Ltd Q3FY26 Concall Highlights\nMcap- Rs11,500 Cr\nCMP- Rs- 121\nGroup Financial Performance (Q3 FY26 and 9MFY26)\nThe group reported steady improvement in profitability and scale. For nine months ended December 2025, consolidated PAT was Rs 549 Cr, up 45% YoY, while post-minority PAT was Rs 459 Cr, up 56% YoY. Consolidated revenue for 9MFY26 stood at Rs 8,896 Cr. For Q3FY26, consolidated PAT was Rs 270 Cr and revenue was Rs 4,715 Cr, supported by strong performance in asset management, insurance and credit businesses. Underlying businesses continued to show stable growth, while consolidated numbers also reflected stake sale gains and certain exceptional items.\nBusiness Model and P&L Structure\nManagement explained that Edelweiss’ consolidated P&L has two parts: operating businesses and the corporate/holding company. Operating businesses generate steady, growing profits and are independently managed with their own boards and capital. The corporate entity undertakes capital allocation, treasury support and incubation of new businesses, but its P&L is more volatile due to interest costs, dividends, capital gains and stake sales. The focus remains on growing business PAT at ~20% annually and reducing corporate debt, which has been taken earlier to support subsidiaries.\nAlternative Asset Management (EAAA)\nThe alternatives platform remains a key growth engine. Fee-paying AUM grew 33% YoY to about Rs 41,920 Cr. Fundraising momentum is strong with ~Rs 7,500+ Cr raised in nine months, and management expects to sustain ~20%+ AUM growth. The platform is multi-strategy across private credit and real assets. Real assets now form a larger share with focus on operating assets in roads, energy, renewables and commercial real estate. New funds such as Performing Credit Fund IV and sector InvITs in energy and transportation are seeing traction. EAAA’s DRHP has been filed, and listing is targeted within the usual 4–6 month IPO timeline, primarily to create visibility, unlock value and support corporate deleveraging.\nMutual Fund Business\nThe mutual fund business showed strong traction with equity AUM up 33% YoY to ~Rs 83,000 Cr and total AUM growth of ~18% YoY. SIP book crossed Rs 500 Cr monthly, up ~55% YoY, and retail folios reached ~34 lakh. Growth is driven by branch expansion, deeper distributor engagement, product innovation and consistent performance rather than star-manager concentration. Tier 2 and 3 cities are key growth areas. Profitability is improving alongside AUM scale.\nAsset Reconstruction (ARC)\nARC continues to focus on recoveries from legacy assets, with Rs 842 Cr recovered in the quarter. Retail assets now form ~25% of capital deployed versus ~15% a year ago, showing diversification beyond large corporate NPAs. The business is currently in a recovery cycle for the industry, with slower new acquisitions due to lower system NPAs. The ARC entity is over-capitalized, and excess capital is being returned via dividends to improve ROE and support group deleveraging.\nNBFC and MSME Lending\nThe MSME business has restarted growth after balance sheet clean-up. Disbursements rose sharply, with monthly run-rate moving from ~Rs 25–30 Cr earlier to ~Rs 100+ Cr now. Growth is supported by a new leadership team, technology investments, new products and branch additions. Asset quality metrics remain controlled, and the wholesale book has been reduced significantly YoY.\nEicher Motors delivered strong Q3 FY26 results with 22.94% YoY revenue growth and a notable 96 bps sequential improvement in consolidated EBITDA margin to 25.46%.

At 9.46 am, it traded at Rs 4,324 on the NSE. It posted an increase in consolidated profit after tax by 61% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to ₹1,684 crore for the third quarter of FY26.\nHeidelbergCement India reported net profit for the quarter ended December 2025 at Rs 15.6 crore compared to Rs 5.2 crore in the same quarter last year.\nShares traded at Rs 170.25 on the NSE, down 1%.\nEdelweiss Financial Services Ltd Q3FY26 Concall Highlights\nMcap- Rs11,500 Cr\nCMP- Rs- 121\nGroup Financial Performance (Q3 FY26 and 9MFY26)\nThe group reported steady improvement in profitability and scale. For nine months ended December 2025, consolidated PAT was Rs 549 Cr, up 45% YoY, while post-minority PAT was Rs 459 Cr, up 56% YoY. Consolidated revenue for 9MFY26 stood at Rs 8,896 Cr. For Q3FY26, consolidated PAT was Rs 270 Cr and revenue was Rs 4,715 Cr, supported by strong performance in asset management, insurance and credit businesses. Underlying businesses continued to show stable growth, while consolidated numbers also reflected stake sale gains and certain exceptional items.\nBusiness Model and P&L Structure\nManagement explained that Edelweiss’ consolidated P&L has two parts: operating businesses and the corporate/holding company. Operating businesses generate steady, growing profits and are independently managed with their own boards and capital. The corporate entity undertakes capital allocation, treasury support and incubation of new businesses, but its P&L is more volatile due to interest costs, dividends, capital gains and stake sales. The focus remains on growing business PAT at ~20% annually and reducing corporate debt, which has been taken earlier to support subsidiaries.\nAlternative Asset Management (EAAA)\nThe alternatives platform remains a key growth engine. Fee-paying AUM grew 33% YoY to about Rs 41,920 Cr. Fundraising momentum is strong with ~Rs 7,500+ Cr raised in nine months, and management expects to sustain ~20%+ AUM growth. The platform is multi-strategy across private credit and real assets. Real assets now form a larger share with focus on operating assets in roads, energy, renewables and commercial real estate. New funds such as Performing Credit Fund IV and sector InvITs in energy and transportation are seeing traction. EAAA’s DRHP has been filed, and listing is targeted within the usual 4–6 month IPO timeline, primarily to create visibility, unlock value and support corporate deleveraging.\nMutual Fund Business\nThe mutual fund business showed strong traction with equity AUM up 33% YoY to ~Rs 83,000 Cr and total AUM growth of ~18% YoY. SIP book crossed Rs 500 Cr monthly, up ~55% YoY, and retail folios reached ~34 lakh. Growth is driven by branch expansion, deeper distributor engagement, product innovation and consistent performance rather than star-manager concentration. Tier 2 and 3 cities are key growth areas. Profitability is improving alongside AUM scale.\nAsset Reconstruction (ARC)\nARC continues to focus on recoveries from legacy assets, with Rs 842 Cr recovered in the quarter. Retail assets now form ~25% of capital deployed versus ~15% a year ago, showing diversification beyond large corporate NPAs. The business is currently in a recovery cycle for the industry, with slower new acquisitions due to lower system NPAs. The ARC entity is over-capitalized, and excess capital is being returned via dividends to improve ROE and support group deleveraging.\nNBFC and MSME Lending\nThe MSME business has restarted growth after balance sheet clean-up. Disbursements rose sharply, with monthly run-rate moving from ~Rs 25–30 Cr earlier to ~Rs 100+ Cr now. Growth is supported by a new leadership team, technology investments, new products and branch additions. Asset quality metrics remain controlled, and the wholesale book has been reduced significantly YoY.\nEicher Motors delivered strong Q3 FY26 results with 22.94% YoY revenue growth and a notable 96 bps sequential improvement in consolidated EBITDA margin to 25.46%. The VECV joint venture also contributed significantly with 35.60% QoQ profit growth, highlighting effective operational management and leverage.\nTop gainers of Nifty 50:\nEicher Motors (+6.27%), Apollo Hospitals (+5.15%), Max Health (+2.21%), TMPV (+1.36%), M&M (+1.32%)\nTop losers:\nONGC (-1.80%), Coal India (-1.58%), Hindalco (-1.32%), Eternal (-0.74%), Grasim (-0.68%)\nSensex rose by 131.72 pts or 0.16% to 84,405.64 at 9.21 am after opening at 84,339.15against the previous close of 84,273.92.

At 9.46 am, it traded at Rs 4,324 on the NSE. It posted an increase in consolidated profit after tax by 61% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to ₹1,684 crore for the third quarter of FY26.\nHeidelbergCement India reported net profit for the quarter ended December 2025 at Rs 15.6 crore compared to Rs 5.2 crore in the same quarter last year.\nShares traded at Rs 170.25 on the NSE, down 1%.\nEdelweiss Financial Services Ltd Q3FY26 Concall Highlights\nMcap- Rs11,500 Cr\nCMP- Rs- 121\nGroup Financial Performance (Q3 FY26 and 9MFY26)\nThe group reported steady improvement in profitability and scale. For nine months ended December 2025, consolidated PAT was Rs 549 Cr, up 45% YoY, while post-minority PAT was Rs 459 Cr, up 56% YoY. Consolidated revenue for 9MFY26 stood at Rs 8,896 Cr. For Q3FY26, consolidated PAT was Rs 270 Cr and revenue was Rs 4,715 Cr, supported by strong performance in asset management, insurance and credit businesses. Underlying businesses continued to show stable growth, while consolidated numbers also reflected stake sale gains and certain exceptional items.\nBusiness Model and P&L Structure\nManagement explained that Edelweiss’ consolidated P&L has two parts: operating businesses and the corporate/holding company. Operating businesses generate steady, growing profits and are independently managed with their own boards and capital. The corporate entity undertakes capital allocation, treasury support and incubation of new businesses, but its P&L is more volatile due to interest costs, dividends, capital gains and stake sales. The focus remains on growing business PAT at ~20% annually and reducing corporate debt, which has been taken earlier to support subsidiaries.\nAlternative Asset Management (EAAA)\nThe alternatives platform remains a key growth engine. Fee-paying AUM grew 33% YoY to about Rs 41,920 Cr. Fundraising momentum is strong with ~Rs 7,500+ Cr raised in nine months, and management expects to sustain ~20%+ AUM growth. The platform is multi-strategy across private credit and real assets. Real assets now form a larger share with focus on operating assets in roads, energy, renewables and commercial real estate. New funds such as Performing Credit Fund IV and sector InvITs in energy and transportation are seeing traction. EAAA’s DRHP has been filed, and listing is targeted within the usual 4–6 month IPO timeline, primarily to create visibility, unlock value and support corporate deleveraging.\nMutual Fund Business\nThe mutual fund business showed strong traction with equity AUM up 33% YoY to ~Rs 83,000 Cr and total AUM growth of ~18% YoY. SIP book crossed Rs 500 Cr monthly, up ~55% YoY, and retail folios reached ~34 lakh. Growth is driven by branch expansion, deeper distributor engagement, product innovation and consistent performance rather than star-manager concentration. Tier 2 and 3 cities are key growth areas. Profitability is improving alongside AUM scale.\nAsset Reconstruction (ARC)\nARC continues to focus on recoveries from legacy assets, with Rs 842 Cr recovered in the quarter. Retail assets now form ~25% of capital deployed versus ~15% a year ago, showing diversification beyond large corporate NPAs. The business is currently in a recovery cycle for the industry, with slower new acquisitions due to lower system NPAs. The ARC entity is over-capitalized, and excess capital is being returned via dividends to improve ROE and support group deleveraging.\nNBFC and MSME Lending\nThe MSME business has restarted growth after balance sheet clean-up. Disbursements rose sharply, with monthly run-rate moving from ~Rs 25–30 Cr earlier to ~Rs 100+ Cr now. Growth is supported by a new leadership team, technology investments, new products and branch additions. Asset quality metrics remain controlled, and the wholesale book has been reduced significantly YoY.\nEicher Motors delivered strong Q3 FY26 results with 22.94% YoY revenue growth and a notable 96 bps sequential improvement in consolidated EBITDA margin to 25.46%. The VECV joint venture also contributed significantly with 35.60% QoQ profit growth, highlighting effective operational management and leverage.\nTop gainers of Nifty 50:\nEicher Motors (+6.27%), Apollo Hospitals (+5.15%), Max Health (+2.21%), TMPV (+1.36%), M&M (+1.32%)\nTop losers:\nONGC (-1.80%), Coal India (-1.58%), Hindalco (-1.32%), Eternal (-0.74%), Grasim (-0.68%)\nSensex rose by 131.72 pts or 0.16% to 84,405.64 at 9.21 am after opening at 84,339.15against the previous close of 84,273.92.

SIP book crossed Rs 500 Cr monthly, up ~55% YoY, and retail folios reached ~34 lakh. Growth is driven by branch expansion, deeper distributor engagement, product innovation and consistent performance rather than star-manager concentration. Tier 2 and 3 cities are key growth areas. Profitability is improving alongside AUM scale.\nAsset Reconstruction (ARC)\nARC continues to focus on recoveries from legacy assets, with Rs 842 Cr recovered in the quarter. Retail assets now form ~25% of capital deployed versus ~15% a year ago, showing diversification beyond large corporate NPAs. The business is currently in a recovery cycle for the industry, with slower new acquisitions due to lower system NPAs. The ARC entity is over-capitalized, and excess capital is being returned via dividends to improve ROE and support group deleveraging.\nNBFC and MSME Lending\nThe MSME business has restarted growth after balance sheet clean-up. Disbursements rose sharply, with monthly run-rate moving from ~Rs 25–30 Cr earlier to ~Rs 100+ Cr now. Growth is supported by a new leadership team, technology investments, new products and branch additions. Asset quality metrics remain controlled, and the wholesale book has been reduced significantly YoY.\nEicher Motors delivered strong Q3 FY26 results with 22.94% YoY revenue growth and a notable 96 bps sequential improvement in consolidated EBITDA margin to 25.46%. The VECV joint venture also contributed significantly with 35.60% QoQ profit growth, highlighting effective operational management and leverage.\nTop gainers of Nifty 50:\nEicher Motors (+6.27%), Apollo Hospitals (+5.15%), Max Health (+2.21%), TMPV (+1.36%), M&M (+1.32%)\nTop losers:\nONGC (-1.80%), Coal India (-1.58%), Hindalco (-1.32%), Eternal (-0.74%), Grasim (-0.68%)\nSensex rose by 131.72 pts or 0.16% to 84,405.64 at 9.21 am after opening at 84,339.15against the previous close of 84,273.92.
